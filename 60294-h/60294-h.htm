</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A PREFACE is the place
where an author usually apologizes
to the public for what
he is about to inflict. Such
being the case, I hasten to
state that I am only jointly
responsible for this aggregation
of tales, which resemble, more than anything
else, the creations of a disordered brain.</p>

<p>The origin of the Welsh Rarebit Tales was
as follows: A certain literary club, of which I
am a member, is accustomed to hold semi-occasional
meetings at some of the uptown hotels.
At the close of the dinner each of the fifteen
members is permitted to read to the others what
he considers his most acute spasm since the previous
meeting. The good and bad points of the
manuscript are then discussed, and we believe
that much mutual benefit is thereby derived.</p>

<p>Having run short of first-class plots, the club
at a recent meeting decided to try a gastro-literary
experiment. Knowing the effect upon the
digestive and cerebral organs of indulging in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
concentrated food before retiring, we each and
every one partook, just before adjourning, of the
following combination:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">1 Large Portion Welsh Rarebit,</div>
<div class="verse">1 Broiled Live Lobster,</div>
<div class="verse">2 Pieces Home Made Mince Pie,</div>
<div class="verse">1 Portion Cucumber Salad.</div>
</div></div>

<p>At the second meeting of the club (the next
meeting, by the way, had to be postponed on
account of illness of fourteen of the members)
the accompanying tales were related.</p>

<p>Partly as a warning to injudicious diners, we
decided to publish the result of our experiment,
hoping that all who read this book, and see the
nightmares which were produced, will be warned
never to try a similar feat (or eat).</p>

<p>By unanimous sentence of the other fourteen
members, and as a punishment for having been
the originator of the scheme, mine was chosen
as the unlucky name under which the Tales
should appear.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Professor Aloysius Holbrok
resigned his chair as head
of the department of Synthetic
Chemistry in one of the famous
American colleges his
friends wondered; for they
well knew that his greatest
pleasure in life lay in original
investigations. When two weeks later the papers
stated that the learned chemist had been
taken to the Rathborn Asylum for the Insane,
wonder changed to inordinate curiosity.</p>

<p>Although nothing definite was published in
the papers, there were hints of strange things
which had taken place in the private laboratory
on Brimmer Street; and before long a story
was current that, as a result of dabbling in the
mysteries of psychology, a man had been killed
while undergoing one of Professor Holbrok&#8217;s
experiments.</p>

<p>It is to clear up this mystery and to refute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the charges of murder that I, who served for
ten years as his assistant, am about to write this
account, which, to the best of my knowledge
and belief, contains the facts of the case.</p>

<p>I had noticed for the year previous that Professor
Holbrok was much preoccupied; but I
knew that he was working over some new experiment.
Many times when I came to his
door at five o&#8217;clock to clean up as usual for the
next day, I found a notice pinned on the door
telling me that he was in the midst of important
work and would not need me again that
day. I thought nothing about it at the time;
for when he was experimenting with Dr. Bicknell,
performing operations with hypnotism instead
of anæsthetics, there were weeks at a time
when I was not allowed even a glimpse of the
inside of the laboratories. One day, however,
as I came in to report, the professor called me
aside and told me that he wanted to have a talk
with me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, Frederick,&#8221; he began, &#8220;that I
have been working and experimenting for a long
time on a new problem, and I have not told you
or anyone else the object of my toil. But now
I have come to a point where I must take some
one into my confidence. I need an assistant;
and I know of no one I can trust more than
you, who have been with me now nearly a dozen
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was naturally flattered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>&#8220;Frederick,&#8221; he continued, rising and placing
his hand on my shoulder, &#8220;this experiment is
the greatest one of my life. I am going to do
what has never been done in the history of the
world, except by God himself,&mdash;I am going
to <i>make a man</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not realize at first what he meant. I
was startled, not only by his wild statement,
but also by the intense tone in which he had
spoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not understand,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but let
me explain. You know enough chemistry to
realize that everything&mdash;water, air, food, all
things which we use in every-day life&mdash;are
merely combinations of certain simple elements.
As you have seen me, by means of an electric
current, decompose a jar of pure water into its
two component parts,&mdash;two molecules of hydrogen
to every molecule of oxygen,&mdash;so you can
bring these same elements together in the gaseous
state; and if the correct proportions are observed,
when an electric spark or flame is
brought into contact with the mixture, you will
obtain again the liquid water. This is only a
simple case; but the chemical laws which govern
it hold equally well for every known substance
found in nature. There are only about seventy-five
known elements, and of these less than
thirty compose the majority of the things found
in every-day life.</p>

<p>&#8220;During the last six months I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
working with these elements, making different
substances. I have taken a piece of wood, decomposed
it with acids, analyzed it quantitatively
and qualitatively, finding the proportions
in which its elements were combined. Then I
have taken similar elements, brought them together
in the same proportions, and I have produced
a piece of wood so natural you would
have sworn it grew upon a tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been analyzing and then making
again every common thing which you see in
nature, but I was only practicing. I have had
an end in view. Finally, I took a human body
which I obtained from Dr. Bicknell, at the medical
college; and I analyzed the flesh, the bones,
the blood, in short, every part of it. What did
I find? Of that body, weighing 165 pounds,
106 pounds was nothing but water, pure water,
such as you may draw at the tap over yonder.
And the blood which in the man&#8217;s life had gone
coursing through his veins, bringing nourishment
to every part&mdash;what was that? Nothing but
a serum filled with little cellular red corpuscles,
which, in their turn, were only combinations of
carbon, oxygen, sulphur, and a few other simple
elements.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have taken the sternum bone from a dead
man&#8217;s chest, analyzed it, then brought together
similar elements, placed them in a mould, and I
have produced a bone which was just as real as
the one with which I started. There were only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
two things in nature which I could not reproduce.
One was starch, that substance whose
analysis has defied chemists of all ages; the
other was flesh. Though I have analyzed bits
of it carefully, when I have brought together
again those elementary parts flesh would not
form.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chemists all over the world have been able
to resolve the flesh into proteids, the awesome
proteids, as they are called. They form the
principal solids of the muscular, nervous, and
granular tissues, the serum of the blood and of
lymph. But no man on earth except myself
has ever been able to create a proteid. They
have missed the whole secret because they have
been working at ordinary temperatures. Just
as the drop of water will not form from its two
gases at 4,500 degrees Fah., nor at its own lower
explosion temperature, unless the spark be added,
so will protoplasm not form except under certain
electric and thermal conditions.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the last two months I have been working
on these lines alone, varying my temperatures
from the extreme cold produced by liquid
air, to the intense heat of the compound blowpipe;
and I have been repaid. A fortnight ago
I discovered how it was that I had erred, and
since then I have succeeded in everything I
have tried. I have formed the proteids, the
fats, and the carbohydrates which go to make up
protoplasm; and with these for my solid foundations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
I have made every minute and complicated
organ of the body. I have done more than that&mdash;I
have put these component parts together,
and now behold what I have made.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_008fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption"><b>&#8220;He lifted the sheet and I started back with a strange
mixture of awe and horror.&#8221;</b> (See page 8.)</p>

<p>He lifted a sheet, which was thrown over a
heap of something on the table, and I started
back with a strange mixture of awe and horror;
for, stretched out on that marble slab, lay a
naked body, which, if it had never been a man,
living and breathing, as I lived and breathed,
then I would have sworn I dreamed.</p>

<p>The thoughts which began to come into my
mind probably showed in my face, for the professor
said: &#8220;You doubt? You think that I
have lost my reason, and this thing is some man
I have killed. Well, I do not blame you. A
year ago I myself would have scoffed at the very
idea of creating such a man. But you shall see,
you shall be convinced, for in the next part of
the experiment I must have your help. I will
show you how I have made this man, or I will
make another before your eyes. Then you and
I, we will go further; we will do what no one
but God has ever done before&mdash;we will make
that inert mass <i>a living man</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The horror of the thing began to leave me,
for I was fascinated by what he said, and I
began to feel the same spirit with which he was
inspired.</p>



<p>He took me into his private laboratory, and
before my eyes, with only the contents of a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>re-agent bottles, a blowpipe, and an electric battery,
he made a mass of human flesh. I will
not give you the formula, neither will I tell you
in detail how it was done. God forbid that any
other man should see what I saw afterward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, all that remains is the final experiment,
and that with your help I propose making
to-night,&#8221; said the Professor. &#8220;What we have
to do is as much of a riddle to me as it is to
you. It is purely and simply an experiment.
I am going to pass through that lifeless clay the
same current of electricity which, if sent through
a living man, would produce death. Of course,
with a man who had died from the giving out of
some vital function I could not hope to succeed,
but the organs of this man which I have made
are in a perfectly healthy condition. It is my
hope, therefore, that the current which would
destroy a living man will bring this thing to life.&#8221;</p>

<p>We bore that naked body, not a corpse, and
yet so terribly like, into the electric laboratory,
and laid it on a slab of slate. Just at the base
of its brain we scraped a little bare spot not
larger than a pea, and, as I live, a drop of blood
oozed out. On the right wrist, just over the
pulse, we made another abrasion, and to these
spots we brought the positive and negative wires
from off the mains of the street current outside.</p>

<p>I held the two bare uninsulated bits of copper
close to the flesh, Professor Holbrok switched
into circuit 2,000 volts of electricity, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
before our starting eyes that thing which was
only a mass of chemical compounds <i>became a
man</i>.</p>

<p>A convulsive twitching brought the body
almost into a sitting position, then the mouth
opened and there burst forth from the lips a
groan.</p>

<p>I have been in the midst of battles, and I
have seen men dying all around me, torn to
ribbons by shot and shell, and I have not flinched;
but when I tore the wires from that writhing,
groaning shape, and saw its chest begin to heave
with spasmodic breathing, I fainted.</p>

<p>When I came to myself I was lying half
across the slab of slate, and the room was filled
with a sickening stench, an odor of burning flesh.
I looked for the writhing form which I had last
seen on the table; but those wires, with their
deadly current, which I tried to tear away as I
fainted, must have been directed back by a
Higher Hand, for there remained on the slab
only a charred and cinder-like mass.</p>

<p>And the man who had made a man could not
explain, for he was crawling about on the floor,
counting the nails in the boards and laughing
wildly.</p>

<p class="ph1">IN THE LOWER PASSAGE.</p>

<div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE were sitting on the deck
of the &#8220;Empress of India,&#8221;
homeward bound for Southampton.
I was returning on
a six months&#8217; leave from hospital
duty in Calcutta, and
the Colonel was retiring from
his post in the northern provinces, where he had
served with credit for over fifteen years. He
had resigned suddenly a month before. His
resignation had been refused, whereupon he immediately
gave up everything to his second in
command, and took the next steamer home, for
a year&#8217;s stay, according to the belief of the
home government, but with a private resolution
never to return.</p>

<p>I knew that he had had some terrible experience
in which his dearest friend, Lieutenant
Arthur Stebbins, had been killed; but beyond
that I was as ignorant as the home government
which had refused to sanction his resignation.
That night, however, as we sat on deck, and felt
the lingering tremor of the giant screw which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was driving us back to home and civilization,
something prompted the Colonel to confide
in me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not acting in my official capacity when
Arthur Stebbins and I went up into the Junga
district,&#8221; the Colonel said in answer to a chance
remark of mine, &#8220;it was simply and solely to
visit the haunted city of Mubapur. You have
been in India for two years, and you may have
heard some of the strange tales in regard to the
place; but as nearly every little out-of-the-way
province in India has its peculiar tale of hidden
wealth or strange craft, you have probably paid
no attention to the stories of Mubapur.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had heard the natives, when they thought
no one was listening, speak of the lost tribe of
Jadacks, which had once lived up among the
Ora Mountains. It seems that they were
not like other natives, but a white people
almost giant in size, and their chief city was
Mubapur. But years ago, some say ten, others
fifty, and still others a hundred, for these natives
have no idea of time, a great plague came
upon the white tribe, and it was smitten from
the land.</p>

<p>&#8220;They believed that the gods had in some
way been offended, and that this people were
annihilated in punishment. Anyway, we could
not get one of our coolie boys within two miles
of the place after nightfall; and they told strange
stories of immense white creatures which flitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
about the place, and of moanings and wailings
which could be heard on still nights when the
wind was from Mubapur.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stebbins and I were on a shooting expedition
in the Junga district when he, remembering
the wild tales he had heard, proposed that we
turn aside, and make the two days&#8217; trip to the
haunted city. As time was of no particular
account just then, I agreed; and after leaving
our coolie bearers two miles from the town, for
they refused all bribes and ignored all threats to
go farther, we entered the deserted and grass-grown
streets of Mubapur. It was near dark
when we arrived; and we decided to put up for
the night in a little temple, the roof of which still
defied the action of the wind and rain, and which
offered us a comfortable retreat.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I was building a fire just outside the
entrance preparatory to getting supper, I heard
Stebbins call, and hurrying in, found him standing
behind the chief altar of the place, and gazing
down a steep stairway which apparently led
into the bowels of the earth. He put up his
hand as I entered, and whispered, &#8216;Listen; do
you hear anything?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I held my breath listening, and from somewhere
down in the damp depths below I heard a
strange sound floating upwards. It might have
been a chant such as the hill men sing on the
eve of battle; or it might have been only
the wind soughing through underground passages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
but anyway it was weird enough in its
effect on both of us, so that we hurried out to
the fire and busied ourselves getting supper. It
is strange how differently the tales we had
heard seemed in that ruined temple with night
coming on, from what they had in the bright
daylight in the market place at Calcutta.</p>

<p>&#8220;We slept very close together that night just
inside the entrance to the temple, and all through
the watches I fancied I heard that solemn dirge
rising and falling in the stillness of the night.
Once I awoke to find Stebbins talking softly,
and I heard him mutter something about a great
white beast; but when I looked at him his eyes
were shut, and he was sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next morning after breakfast I asked
him the question for which I knew he was waiting,&mdash;should
we descend the narrow stairway
into the passage? He was anxious to make the
attempt; and after getting ready some torches
and looking carefully to our guns, we started
down the slippery stairway.</p>

<p>&#8220;The steps ended abruptly, and we found
ourselves in a long, narrow passage. What
struck me at once as peculiar as we proceeded
were some little cavities in the floor at regular
intervals, such as might have been made by a
person walking continuously, as a prisoner walks
in his cell. But the stride was nearly twice that
of an ordinary man. After walking about fifty
paces we came to another stairway leading to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
still lower passage, and just as we were about to
descend we heard a noise as of something running
swiftly below us. I looked at Stebbins to
see if he had seen anything, for he was nearer
to the head of the stairway than I; but there
was only a white, determined look on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Come on, Colonel,&#8217; he called, and led the
way down the stairs. At the farther end of
this passage we came to a square opening into
a kind of vault, and we paused for a moment
before it. Then, in that stillness of the tomb,
sixty feet below the surface of the ground, and
just on the other side of the little opening, we
heard a low moaning, and I would have sworn
it was a man who made the sounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;We held our rifles a little closer, and crawled
through the aperture, pausing to look about us.
We both nearly dropped our guns in our excitement;
for, crouched in the farther corner, was
a great white, hairy creature, watching us with
red, flaming eyes. Then, even before we could
recover ourselves, the thing gave a kind of
guttural cry of anger, and started toward us.
As it rose to its feet, I swear to you I turned
sick as a woman. The beast was over eight feet
tall, and was covered with a thick growth of hair
which was snow white. Its arms were once and
a half the length of those of a common man, and
its head was set low on its shoulders like that of
an ape or a monkey; but the skin beneath the
hair was <i>as white as yours or mine</i>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>&#8220;I heard the Lieutenant&#8217;s gun go off, but the
Thing never stopped. I raised my four-bore
and let drive with the left barrel; then, overcome
with a nameless fear of that great white
beast, I called wildly to Arthur to follow me,
and plunged through the opening and ran
with all my strength toward the upper passage.
It was not until I felt the fresh air on
my face that I stopped to take breath, and I
was so weak I could scarcely stand. Then,
if you can, imagine my horror to find that I was
alone. The Lieutenant was nowhere in sight.
I called down the passage, and I could hear my
voice echoing down the dismal place, but there
was no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think what you may; but I tell you it took
more courage for me to force myself down into
that vault again than it would to have walked up
the steps to the scaffold. I crept fearfully along
the passage, calling weakly every few minutes,
and dreading what I should find; but&mdash;there
was nothing to find.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colonel paused, putting his hand over his
eyes, and I could see by the moonlight that his
face was white and drawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;And did you not find him in the lower passage?&#8221;
I asked, when the silence had become
oppressive.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I did not find the Lieutenant,&#8221; he answered;
&#8220;but when I came to the little square
opening before the vault, there were some bloody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
little pieces scattered about the floor, and the
place was all slippery, but there was no Lieutenant.
You know it takes four horses to pull
a man apart, and you can judge of the strength
of that white beast when I tell you that there
was not left of Arthur Stebbins a piece as big as
your two hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I looked at that floor with the ghastly
things which covered it, a wild rage took possession
of me. I knew that the creature was in the
room beyond, for I could hear a crunching as a
dog makes with a bone. I rushed through the
opening, straight toward the corner where it was
crouching. It saw me coming, and leaped to its
feet. Again that sickening fear that I had felt
before came over me; but I stood my ground
and waited till it nearly reached me. Then, with
the muzzle of my gun almost against it, I fired
both barrels full into its breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must have fainted or gone off my head
after that, for the next thing I knew I was lying
in a native&#8217;s hut on the Durbo road. Zur Khan,
the man who owned the bungalow, said that he
had found me four days before, wandering about
on the plains, stark mad, and had taken me
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Thing in the passage?&#8221; I asked
breathlessly. &#8220;Did you never go back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; when I had recovered a little, I went
back to the Mubapur Temple,&#8221; answered the
Colonel; but he was silent for some minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
before he answered the first part of my question.</p>

<p>&#8220;In my report to the Government I said that
Lieutenant Arthur Stebbins was torn to pieces
in the lower passage of a Mubapur Temple by
an immense white <i>ape</i>,&mdash;but I lied,&#8221; he added
quietly.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_023.jpg"  alt="W"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WILLIAM WATERS was not
in any way what you would
call a braggart, yet upon two
things did he pride himself.
These two things were: first,
an earnest and sincere contempt
for all things supernatural;
and, secondly, a marksmanship with a
Colt&#8217;s No. 4 revolver which bordered on the
marvelous. He had on several occasions proved
his bravery by such feats as sleeping alone an
entire night in a house said to be haunted, and
by visiting a country graveyard at midnight,
and digging up a corpse. He had likewise won
numerous bets by pumping six bullets into an
inch and a half bull&#8217;s eye at a distance of sixteen
paces, and being a healthy and vigorous animal
his pride was perhaps more or less excusable.</p>

<p>In the house in which Waters had his rooms
there also lived a Fool. His particular brand of
folly was practical joking, which is universally
recognized by intelligent men as a particularly
acute and dangerous kind of idiocy. As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
child The Fool had soaked a neighbor&#8217;s cat in
kerosene and then applied a match. Since then
he had performed many other equally humorous
feats.</p>

<p>After much planning The Fool devised a joke,
the victim of which was to be The Man Who
Knew Not Fear, as the jester sneeringly called
Waters.</p>

<p>The prologue to this joke was the substitution
of blanks in each of the six chambers of the
No. 4 Colt&#8217;s, which hung over the headboard in
William Waters&#8217;s sleeping-room, not as a
weapon of defense, but as a glittering little possession
dear to the heart of its owner.</p>

<p>The Fool had once, in the presence of all the
people at the dinner table, asked Waters what
he would do should he wake up at night and
find a ghost in the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire a bullet straight at his heart, so be
sure and wear a breastplate,&#8221; Waters answered
promptly, and the laugh had been on the
joker.</p>

<p>After removing the cartridges from the revolver,
The Fool withdrew the bullets from
each, and placed them in his pocket. He had
that day also laid in a supply of phosphorescent
paint and several yards of white muslin.</p>

<p>Waters never locked his door at night, for he
was as free from fear of all things physical as
from those supernatural. This of course made
the program which The Fool had arranged easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to carry out, though he would not have hesitated
at a little thing like stealing the key and
having an impression made. He was a very
thorough practical joker.</p>

<p>That night as the French clock in the hall
outside Waters&#8217;s room was striking twelve The
Man Who Knew Not Fear was awakened by a
rattling of chains and a dismal moaning.</p>

<p>As he opened his eyes he saw standing in
the darkest corner of the room a white-robed
figure, which glistened with phosphorescent
lights as it waved its arms to and fro. Without
a moment&#8217;s hesitation, Waters reached for his
revolver, and leveling it at the moaning figure,
fired full at its breast.</p>

<p>The Fool, chuckling to himself behind the
sheet, thrust his hand upon his heart, and apparently
plucking something from the folds of
cloth, he tossed back toward the bed a bullet.</p>

<p>The Man Who Knew Not Fear reached for
the heavy little object that he had felt strike
the bed-clothes, and his hand touching the bit
of lead, he picked it up curiously, then realizing
what it was that he held, he sat up stiffly in
bed, and tried to raise his arm again. But his
muscles refused to obey. The thought that his
revolver had been tampered with never entered
his head. For the first time in his life a fear,
sickening and unmanning as it was new, came
over him. He recognized in that little piece of
lead a bullet from the gun which had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
before failed him. What was that moaning
Thing upon which powder and lead had no effect?
Three times he tried to raise his arm, and each
time it fell back upon the bed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the rattling of chains began once
more, and with eyes starting from his head
because of his fear, Waters saw the fearsome
shape advancing upon him. By a supreme
effort he raised his arm, and emptied the remaining
five chambers of his revolver at the
approaching figure.</p>

<p>The Fool, who had never ceased moaning
while the shots were being fired, executed a
rapid movement with his hands as if catching
the bullets, and then slowly tossed them back,
one after the other.</p>

<p>The man in bed reached for the little balls of
lead mechanically, then straightened back against
the pillow, and remained perfectly motionless,
staring at the Thing, which had now stopped
again and was groaning dismally.</p>

<p>For five minutes neither man moved, then
The Fool, thinking that the joke was once
more on him, for Waters still refused to speak,
gathered his glittering robe about him, and
slunk out.</p>

<p>Back once more in his own room he undressed
hurriedly, and slipped into bed. He was disappointed.
He had expected that Waters would
be terribly frightened, and that he could joke
him unmercifully at the table for the next week.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Then, too, the obstinate silence of the man puzzled
him.</p>

<p>About five o&#8217;clock in the morning he woke up
vaguely alarmed. He did not know what the
matter was, but he could not sleep. He could
not get out of his mind that strange silence of
the man down-stairs. Then, suddenly, a terrible
suspicion came over him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that, my God, not that!&#8221; he cried.
Jumping from the bed he threw on a few clothes,
and crept fearfully down to the scene of his
midnight joke.</p>

<p>He opened the door cautiously, and, feeling
for the button, turned on the electric light.
Then he gave a hysterical cry, half laugh, half
moan, and, rushing from the room, he fled down
the hall out into the street.</p>

<p>For this is what he had seen: in the bed
propped up stiffly against the pillow, and staring
with dull, unseeing eyes into the corner, sat &#8220;The
Man Who Knew not Fear.&#8221; Not a muscle had
he moved since The Fool had left him six hours
before.</p>

<p>One hand still held the silver-mounted revolver,
while in the other were tightly clasped&mdash;six
little leaden balls.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BOBO, the wild man of Borneo,
sat in his iron-barred cage reading
the morning paper, while
he pulled vigorously at a short,
black clay pipe.</p>

<p>It was nearly time for the
show to begin, so he could
only glance hurriedly at the stock report; for
Bobo was interested in copper.</p>

<p>On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays there
was on exhibition in the side-show connected
with Poole Brothers&#8217; Royal Roman Hippodrome
and Three-Ring Circus what was widely advertised
as the only real wild man in captivity.</p>

<p>On alternate days&mdash;that is, on Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Saturdays&mdash;the cage of Bobo
was closed by a gaudily painted cover; and visitors
on those days were told that the wild man
was sick.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this report, there could be
found on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays,
out in one of the New York suburbs, a middle-aged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Irishman named Patsy McLockin. The
connection may not at first be evident.</p>

<p>Patsy wasn&#8217;t nice looking, even when he was
dressed in his best black suit; for, as the people
on Blenden Street remarked, he was too hairy.</p>

<p>He used to wear gloves when on the street,
even in the hottest weather; but he couldn&#8217;t
very well wear gloves on his face, though if he
could it would have saved the small children of
the neighborhood cases of fright both serious
and lasting.</p>

<p>Poole Brothers&#8217; Royal Roman Hippodrome
and Three Ring Circus was playing a winter
engagement in New York City, and had been
very successful.</p>

<p>The show was to start in about two weeks
for a trip through New England; and since
Mrs. Patsy McLockin had consented to remain
in the city till the circus came back in the fall,
Bobo agreed to exhibit himself every day while
on the trip.</p>

<p>When Stetson, manager of the freaks in the
side-show, had spoken to Bobo of the necessity
of appearing every day while traveling, he
had also mentioned a material raise in the wild
man&#8217;s salary.</p>

<p>Every two weeks during the winter Stetson
had written a check for seventy-five dollars in
acknowledgment of services rendered. In the
event of Bobo&#8217;s agreeing to make his appearance
on each of the one-day stands, Stetson was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
authorized by the powers above to draw these
fortnightly checks for one hundred and fifty
dollars, and, after much discussion in the Blenden
Street home, Stetson&#8217;s offer had been
accepted.</p>

<p>On this morning Bobo was trying to decide
whether to sell out his twenty-three shares of
Isle Royal while that stock was at eighty-one, or
to hang on to it for a while, hoping for a rise.</p>

<p>He fully intended to sell out some time during
the next two weeks, for he did not want to
be bothered with the stock while on the Eastern
trip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get together there, you freaks,&#8221; called
Stetson; &#8220;the whistle has just blown, and the
yaps will begin coming in soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bobo tucked his paper into a little wooden
box in the back of the cage, knocked the ashes
out of his pipe, and curled up on the straw,
pretending to go to sleep.</p>

<p>He never worked over time, did Bobo; and
up to the time when Stetson brought him his
piece of meat, and began telling the people of
the terrible struggle which had taken place in
the swamps of Borneo, when the wild man was
captured, Bobo always pretended to be asleep.</p>

<p>When, however, the manager reached a certain
point in his narration, the nearest of the
onlookers were usually startled by a savage
growl, and the wild man from Borneo got up on
all fours.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>Some hysterical woman generally screamed at
this juncture, for, with the help of his make-up
box, Bobo certainly did look the part.</p>

<p>For clothes, he wore merely a ragged breech-cloth
about his loins, while the rest of his body
was bare, save for a tawny growth of red hair.
His skin was stained a dark brown, and in several
places there were great raw-looking spots,
where the manager said Bobo had bitten himself.</p>

<p>But the wild man&#8217;s face was what caused the
alarm on the part of the women and children.
His nose was a snout-like protuberance with
great cavernous holes for nostrils, while his
eyes, peeping out from under bristling brows,
were small and wicked.</p>

<p>All over his face and neck, and extending
down to his breast, was a coarse growth of stiff
red hair.</p>

<p>The manager finished his harangue over Herman,
the Ossified Man, pictures of whom a small
boy began offering to the crowd for the sum
of ten cents each.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next, and last, I call your attention, ladies
and gentlemen, to Bobo, the wild man from
Borneo,&#8221; began the exhibitor.</p>

<p>He was always glad when he came to Bobo,
partly because he was the last freak to describe,
and partly because the wild man always acted
his part so well.</p>



<p>The crowd rushed from in front of the platform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
on which the Ossified Man had been
exhibited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get so near there, boy,&#8221; shouted one
of the attendants to a venturesome youth; &#8220;the
wild man is liable to grab you. He killed a
man that way last week.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stetson began his lurid tale of the fierce
struggle which had taken place when the wild
man was captured, and the crowd of country
people listened open mouthed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throwing this net about his head and
shoulders, we succeeded in getting the creature
to the ground,&#8221; droned Stetson in a sing-song
voice.</p>

<p>This was Bobo&#8217;s cue. He yawned, exposing
a set of yellow fangs, at the sight of which the
small boy in the front row turned a little pale,
and tried to work his way back into the crowd.</p>

<p>Then Bobo growled. Bobo was proud of that
growl. It had taken him weeks to acquire it.
Beginning with a kind of guttural rumbling in
his throat, he worked himself up gradually, and
ended with a ferocious howl.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wild man is hungry, you see,&#8221; said
Stetson; and taking a piece of raw meat from
under the wagon, he held it up to view.</p>

<p class="caption"><b>&#8220;The wild man ran to the bars of the cage and shook
them furiously.&#8221;</b> (See page 35.)</p>

<p>Bobo immediately sprang at the bars of his
cage, and rattled them loudly, chattering fiercely
meanwhile.</p>

<p>The crowd fell back, leaving a clear space in
front of the cage; and the wild man, reaching a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
hairy arm out between the iron bars, seized the
meat, and crawling to a corner, buried his teeth
in the bloody shank.</p>

<p>&#8220;This concludes the entertainment,&#8221; shouted
Stetson, and the crowd reluctantly began to file
out of the tent.</p>

<p>Two months later, while Poole Brothers&#8217; amalgamated
shows were exhibiting in Vermont,
Murphy, one of the side-show attendants, came
to Stetson, and informed him mysteriously that
Bobo was acting queer.</p>

<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t get out of his cage after the show&#8217;s
over in the afternoon like he used to, but stays
there till the evening performance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing queer about that as I can see,&#8221;
answered Stetson carelessly. &#8220;He&#8217;s been putting
more life than usual into the part lately,
and it probably tires him. What&#8217;s the difference
whether he rests in his cage or goes over to the
car? You&#8217;re probably kicking because you have
to bring his supper to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He used to wash the make-up off his face
between the two shows,&#8221; persisted Murphy.
&#8220;But now he keeps it on from ten in the morning
till night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you never take the trouble to wash
the ordinary every-day dirt and grease off your
face, and I don&#8217;t believe you ever would clean
up if it took you the time it does Bobo,&#8221;
replied Stetson irritably, and Murphy retired,
muttering.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>But the other freaks had noticed a change in
the wild man, too. Between performances Bobo
used to play penny ante with the fat man and
the bearded lady, both of which gentlemen now
tried in vain to lure him into a game.</p>

<p>Saturday nights, also, when the last show for
the week was over, the freaks sometimes had a
little &#8220;feed,&#8221; and formerly Bobo had been one
of the most jovial spirits. Lately, however, he
refused to attend any of these gatherings, and
spent most of his time alone.</p>

<p>As Stetson said, though, the freaks were
always complaining about one another, so little
attention was paid to the grumbling in the side-show
tent.</p>

<p>The management couldn&#8217;t afford to offend
Bobo, for there was no denying that the wild
man was the star attraction. He was doing
better work than he ever had done before. He
didn&#8217;t wait for the manager to come to him to
begin acting; but as soon as the crowd appeared,
he was growling and tearing away at the bars
of his cage.</p>

<p>The other freaks complained; for even when
the dog-faced boy was making his worst grimaces
during Stetson&#8217;s description of him, most of the
audience preferred standing in front of the wild
man&#8217;s cage watching his antics.</p>

<p>One Sunday night the attendant, who had
been before rebuffed, again sought out Stetson
with a new tale of woe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>&#8220;Bobo sleeps in his cage every night now,&#8221;
he declared, &#8220;and he&#8217;s been in there all day
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he&#8217;s sick,&#8221; said Stetson, but he
didn&#8217;t believe it.</p>

<p>He himself had noticed a change of late in
the wild man. The meat, which had been
thrown in to him, had formerly been taken out
untouched and given to the lions; but lately
there hadn&#8217;t been any meat left.</p>

<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t sick, neither,&#8221; declared Murphy,
&#8220;but he&#8217;s too damn ugly to live. He tried to
bite me when I changed the water in his dish;
and yesterday, when Skoggy brought him a
newspaper like he used to, to show him the
stock report, Bobo tore it to pieces, and tried to
hit Skoggy with that bar that&#8217;s loose in his
cage.</p>

<p>Stetson consulted with Poole Brothers, and
that night the three men went to the side-show
tent, which was up in readiness for the Monday&#8217;s
performance.</p>

<p>They found Bobo lying asleep in his cage.
He still had on his make-up, but some way he
didn&#8217;t look natural to the Poole Brothers.
They didn&#8217;t go to the side-show tent very often,
and it had been over two months since they had
seen the wild man.</p>

<p>The hair on his arms and breast was thicker
than it used to be, and his teeth seemed longer
and yellower.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>Stetson opened the door of the cage and
called, &#8220;Wake up, Pat. It&#8217;s time for supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wild man opened his eyes quickly, and
snarled like a dog which has been roused
suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time for supper,&#8221; repeated Stetson, stepping
back and clasping his cane a little tighter.</p>

<p>Bobo seized the little iron dish in which they
brought him water, and started to hurl it at the
speaker; but noticing suddenly who it was, he
only growled, &#8220;Don&#8217;t want no more supper;
just had mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger Poole brother looked at a half
gnawed bone lying on the bottom of the cage,
and muttered something which nobody heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re not going to stay here all
night, are you?&#8221; persisted Stetson.</p>

<p>Bobo ran to the door of his cage and seized
the bars, shaking them as he did when the show
was on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why in hell can&#8217;t you leave me alone?&#8221; he
screamed. &#8220;What do you care where I sleep?
Don&#8217;t I do my work? And don&#8217;t I earn my
pay? Then what you kicking about? Git
along, and leave me alone; I&#8217;m sleepy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stetson looked at the two Poole brothers, one
of whom made a sign, and the three men withdrew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks as if we&#8217;d have the genuine article,
instead of a fake, in a week or two more,&#8221;
observed the elder Poole to the manager.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>He had been in the show business for some
years, and wasn&#8217;t easily shocked.</p>

<p>During the next few weeks the freaks had
many causes for complaint. The Bearded Lady
claimed that Bobo had spit at him when he went
by the cage. But the Bearded Lady was a man
of sensitive disposition, and easily offended.</p>

<p>There were other things more serious, however.
Mlle. Mille, one of the albinos, showed
Stetson a black and blue spot on her arm where
the wild man had struck her when she was putting
on her wig, and the snake charmer threatened
to leave the show if Bobo was not locked
in his cage.</p>

<p>One night, therefore, when the wild man was
asleep, three of the attendants stole into the
tent and snapped a couple of strong padlocks
through the staple in the door.</p>

<p>It was a good thing that they did; for the
next day Bobo had a crazy fit before the show
opened up, during which he tried to tear his
cage to pieces. It proved a great attraction,
though; for the country people outside heard
him raving, and the tent was soon packed.</p>

<p>He stopped speaking to any one after that,
and refused to answer when spoken to. He
stayed in his cage all the time, sleeping there
nights, and never touching the cooked food sent
him from the kitchen, but there was never any
meat left over for the lions.</p>

<p>The Royal Roman Hippodrome and Three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Ring Circus played to remarkably good business
all summer, and finally brought up at the
old winter quarters in New York.</p>

<p>One of the first visitors upon their arrival
there was Mrs. Patsy McLockin, who came to
see what in the world had happened to her
husband, for she hadn&#8217;t heard a word from him
for over two months.</p>

<p>Stetson took her into the room where workmen
were getting every thing in order; for the
show was to begin its winter indoor engagement
next day.</p>

<p>In his cage in one corner, gnawing a bloody
shank of meat, crouched Bobo. Stetson took
the woman over to the cage; and Mrs. McLockin,
after looking at the wild man for a few
seconds, broke out sobbing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve gone and made him crazy, you
have,&#8221; she wailed. &#8220;Patsy, dear, don&#8217;t you
know your old woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Bobo, the wild man, continued crunching
his bone, and paid no attention to the woman
in front of his cage. The manager stole out of
the room softly, and left them together. There
was nothing he could do.</p>

<p>Each week he had gone to Bobo&#8217;s cage, and
tried to talk to the wild man, telling him that he
had better give up the business and settle down
somewhere. But the wild man never paid any
attention to him; and when one day Poole Brothers
tried to take him out of his cage by force,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
one man was killed and Stetson himself seriously
injured, so that had to be given up.</p>

<p>All that winter the side show connected with
Poole Brothers&#8217; Royal Roman Hippodrome and
Three Ring Circus played to packed houses;
and probably no one paid any particular attention
to a sad-faced Irish woman of middle age
who spent most of the time standing in front
of the cage of Bobo, the wild man, weeping
silently.</p>

<p class="ph1">AT THE END OF THE ROAD.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_045.jpg"  alt="A"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AT first the road was smooth
and level; there were no hills,
and The Man had many companions.
They laughed with
him and made merry, and
there was no thought of
care.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a pleasant life,&#8221; murmured
The Man; but even as he said the words
he wondered half fearfully if it could last, if the
country through which they passed would always
be as pleasant.</p>

<p>Gradually the way became harder. Quite
often The Man was compelled to pause for
breath, for there were difficult places to get
over; and when he turned for assistance to the
companions who had laughed and jested with
him but a little while before, he found that they
had passed just beyond calling distance. At
least they seemed not to hear him, for they did
not stop. But the way was not all hilly; and
when he came to the smoother places The Man
hurried on faster than before, and, catching up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
with his companions, was welcomed by them,
and they all made merry once more.</p>

<p>The smoother places became rarer, however,
and The Man found himself alone many times,
till one day he was joined by a new companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will be like the others,&#8221; said The Man
bitterly: &#8220;he will not stay with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the other heard him. &#8220;Do not fear,&#8221;
he answered, &#8220;I will stay with you to the journey&#8217;s
end. I will never leave you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, The Man did not like his new
companion. He was not like the others. He
never jested and made merry, and after that
first time he did not speak again. He was gaunt
and thin, and was clothed in rags; but he stayed
with The Man when the others ran on ahead or
lagged behind.</p>

<p>One day when The Man was weary, for there
was no longer any one to cheer him, and the
way had become very hard, he plucked up courage
to speak to his silent companion again.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis true you do not leave me like the rest,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;they all deserted me when we left the
pleasant country; but I do not know you yet.
If we must travel together we should get better
acquainted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine is not a pleasant name, and few care
to know me better than necessity compels,&#8221; answered
the Silent One; &#8220;but had you waited a
little longer you would not have needed to ask.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
I am known by many names, but those who
know me best call me Poverty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Man picked himself up from where he
had thrown himself to rest, and hurried on, trying
to leave his companion behind. But the one
in rags followed close, and when The Man stumbled
and fell, exhausted by his exertions, the
other was just at his heels.</p>

<p>And about this time The Man noticed that a
third wayfarer had joined them. He could not
see the new comer&#8217;s face, however, for he always
kept a little way behind; and there seemed to
be a kind of shroud-like hood over his head.</p>

<p>There were no longer any easy stretches in
the road, and The Man moved slowly. Many
times he stumbled and fell, and each time it was
longer before he rose again. He wondered, but
dared not ask the name of the new arrival who
had moved nearer, and was now but a few steps
behind.</p>

<p>At last The Man came to a part of the way
more difficult than any before; and he lay down
for a few minutes to rest. After a time he tried
to go on, but could not. He was too weak, and
his two companions seemed to be conspiring to
hold him back. He summoned all his strength,
and made one last effort to go on. At first he
seemed to advance a little, but the hand of The
Ragged One thrust him back. He stumbled,
fell, rose again, and staggered on a few steps,
then fell once more and could not rise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>&#8220;This is the end,&#8221; he heard the Silent One
saying; &#8220;and I have kept my word; I am still
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sound of footsteps approaching
stealthily, and The Man opened his eyes with
an effort. The companion who had always
lagged behind was advancing swiftly, and the
black hood was drawn away from his face.</p>

<p>Painfully The Man raised himself on his elbow
and looked at the figure for a second, then
fell back.</p>

<p>&#8220;How strange that I did not know you before,&#8221;
he muttered faintly, for he had seen the
other&#8217;s face, and recognized that it was Death.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_051.jpg"  alt="O"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the afternoon of Saturday,
August 18, 1900, as I was
looking over the daily paper
after my return from the Blendheim
Electric Works, where I
am employed, I noticed in the
advertising department the
following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ENGINEERS AND
SCIENTIFIC MEN.</p>

<p class="center">Ten thousand dollars will be paid to the man or woman
duplicating an instrument now in the possession of this
company&mdash;&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>That was as far as I read. Some cheap advertising
scheme, I thought, and immediately forgot
all about the paragraph.</p>

<p>When, however, towards the last of the month,
I received the regular issue of my pet scientific
paper, I saw on the first page the same glaring
announcement. The fact of the notice being in
that paper was guarantee that the offer was bona
fide, and I looked the article over carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>In addition to the foregoing, the advertisement
went on to state that one of a pair of seismaphones,
an invention with patent pending and
not yet in the market, had been lost. The inventor
was dead, and no one had as yet been
able to construct an instrument similar to the
one now in the company&#8217;s possession.</p>

<p>Further particulars would be sent to any one
satisfying the company that his request for the
same was not prompted by idle curiosity, but
by a desire to aid science in replacing the lost
instrument.</p>

<p>Then came the greatest surprise of all; for,
signed at the bottom of this interesting statement,
as the man representing the company,
was the name of Randolph R. Churchill, Patent
Office, Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>Now Ranny Churchill and I had been roommates
at college, and I had had many a pleasant
visit in his comfortable home on Fourteenth
Street. He had graduated from a technical
school, taken a course in patent law, and soon
after secured a position as one of the governmental
inspectors of patents in Washington.</p>

<p>My annual vacation was to begin the next
week, so I planned a brief trip to Washington
to see the wonderful invention which no one had
apparently been able to duplicate. I did not
write to Churchill, but dropped in on him unexpectedly
Saturday night, September 1.</p>

<p>I had seen him two years before down on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Cape; and I could scarcely believe that the tired,
careworn man who greeted me on my arrival at
the Fourteenth Street house was the same merry,
light-hearted Randolph Churchill I had hunted
and fished with only a couple of summers ago.</p>

<p>He seemed like a man living in constant expectation
of something terrible about to happen,
and, even before our first greetings were over, I
noticed that he paused two or three times and
listened intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can guess to what I owe this visit,&#8221;
he said as he went up-stairs with me to my room,
&#8220;and I would to God I thought you would be
able to accomplish what has so far proved impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>I told him that it was owing to his advertisement
that my present trip had been undertaken,
and begged him to tell me more about
the wonderful invention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till after dinner,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for it is
a long story. We will go to my room, and I
will tell you then a tale as strange as it is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>That dinner was the most dismal affair I ever
attended. Churchill sat like a man in a trance,
completely absorbed in his meditations; and
twice, after listening as I had seen him on my
first arrival, he excused himself and left the
table abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Rannie are such old friends, you
mustn&#8217;t mind him to-night,&#8221; Mrs. Churchill said
to me apologetically, while he was out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
room; &#8220;this terrible affair of the seismaphone
has upset us both completely.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the only mention of the subject
during dinner; but after we had sat in the library
a little while discussing trivial topics, such as
Robert&#8217;s progress in school and the new furnishings
of the house since my last visit, Churchill
and I excused ourselves and went to his private
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may as well start at the very beginning,&#8221;
he said as he threw himself down languidly in
an easy chair, after drawing out from under the
table a long, narrow box, which he placed in his
lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the night of the tenth of last June the
maid brought me the card of a man who was
waiting down-stairs, and who said he wanted to
see me on very important private business. I
glanced at the name scrawled in red ink on the
bit of card-board,&#8216;Martin M. Bradley,&#8217; and wondered
vaguely who the man could be, as I did
not remember ever having heard of him before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told the maid to show him up here to the
den, and a few minutes later she ushered into
this room the man who has been the cause of
these gray hairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was short and sallow, about thirty-five
years of age, as I afterwards found out, though
care and privations had marked him so harshly
that he looked to be nearly fifty. He carried in
his hand this black, leather-covered box which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
you see in my lap; and, after seating himself at
my invitation, began:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You are no doubt surprised, Mr. Churchill,
to have a visit from me, for you probably don&#8217;t
remember ever having heard of me before; but
I&#8217;ve come to you because I know you are in the
patent office, and used to be a friend of mine
back in the seventies, and because, too, I&#8217;ve got
something so valuable here that I don&#8217;t dare to
send it up to the office in the usual way.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He unstrapped, as he spoke, the box, which
he had not let out of his hands since he entered,
and took from it two black, galvanized rubber
instruments, one of which you see here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Churchill lifted from the case a thing which
resembled more than anything else the receiver
of a telephone, except that both ends were
turned out like the one you put to the ear. He
unscrewed this outer cap and handed both parts
to me to examine.</p>

<p>About two inches in from the bell-shaped
end of the cylinder was a diaphragm of peculiar
looking metal, which from appearance I judged
to be an alloy of copper and zinc, with something
else included. Immediately over this, and tightly
stretched across at unequal distances apart,
were some twenty fine German silver wires.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bradley opened one of the instruments, as
I have just done,&#8221; continued Churchill, &#8220;and
proceeded to explain to me its construction.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;These two instruments,&#8217; said he, &#8216;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
together I call the Martin Bradley Seismaphone,
are to the telephone what telegraphy without
wires is to the ordinary method of sending messages.
Both light and sound, as you know,
travel by waves which produce sensation; one
by striking against the retina of the eye, the
other by striking on the drum of the ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The light wave travels with a velocity of
something over 185,000 miles a second, while
the sound wave moves much slower. This
difference, however, is overcome by the mechanical
device in the tube-like section in the middle
part of the instrument.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;As you have seen the sun&#8217;s rays collected
and focused to one small spot by a reading
glass, and the power intensified so that combustion
takes place, so in a similar way does the
seismaphone collect the sound waves, intensify
and bring them to a focus here,&#8217; and he indicated
with his finger a point back of the metal
diaphragm.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;By speaking into one of these instruments
the sound passes through the wires, and strikes
against the metal disk. This sets in motion
a series of waves, which, traveling with the
enormous velocity of which I have spoken,
produce such rapid vibrations that the ear,
unaided, cannot perceive the sound, but by
means of the other half of the seismaphone
these sound waves are collected and so transformed
by the corresponding wires and diaphragm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
that the voice is reproduced by one
instrument in exactly the tone spoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;By means of the seismaphones, you and I,
though separated by thousands of miles, can
converse as easily as though we were in the
same city, connected by an ordinary metallic
current.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a fifteen years&#8217; experience with patent
seekers, I have met many inventive freaks, and
probably something of what I was thinking of
his seismaphone showed in my face, for he
stopped describing it abruptly, and handing me
one of the instruments, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I see you don&#8217;t believe a word I&#8217;ve told
you, and you probably think I&#8217;m crazy; so,
before I tell you anything more about the
construction or possibilities of my invention,
I want to ask you to take this half of the seismaphone,
and go up to the top of your house.
When you are ready to make the test, put the
end marked &#8220;voice&#8221; to your mouth, and say in
a distinct tone, &#8220;Ready, Bradley.&#8221; Then, when
you see this little hammer striking against the
bell, and hear a sharp tinkling inside the cylinder,
put the other end to your ear and listen.
Oh, you may lock me in as you go out, if you
are afraid I may remove any of the bric-à-brac,&#8217;
he added, as I seemed to hesitate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why it was, for I am not over
credulous, but something told me the man was
speaking the truth. And when you stop to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
think of it, what was there so very improbable
about it?</p>

<p>&#8220;Who would have believed one hundred years
ago that we would ever be able to communicate
instantaneously with the inhabitants of another
continent by any means whatever? Or, to
come nearer to our own time, twenty years ago
we would have scoffed at the idea of telegraphing
without wires. Why, then, was it so impossible
to transmit the tones of the human
voice without them? It would be only another
step in the march of progress.</p>

<p>&#8220;I took the instrument and climbed to the
garret without a word. Placing the end he had
indicated to my lips, I said loudly, &#8216;Ready,
Bradley.&#8217; Without any special expectation I
then put the other end to my ear, and at the
result nearly fell over backwards; for, as distinctly
as if the man I had left down-stairs had
been standing beside me, I heard him say,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t speak so loud. I can hear you at
this distance if you merely whisper. Now press
the little button at the end marked &#8220;ear,&#8221; and
wait for the megaphone attachment.&#8217; I did as
he said, and again I jumped and nearly dropped
the instrument, for the room was filled with a
voice which sounded louder than a peal of
thunder.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;By pressing that button you do for the
seismaphone what by putting on the horns you
do for the phonograph or graphophone,&#8217; the stentorian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
voice said. &#8216;You had better press the
button in the other end, for my voice with this
attachment is probably too loud for pleasure.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I pressed the button obediently as directed,
and walked back down-stairs filled with wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall not get to bed any earlier than
Martin Bradley and I did that night, if I stop to
tell you all of our conversation. I found that he
was a man I had known slightly some years ago
when I was trying for the patent office position.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had in his youth been through a technical
school and received a good education; but
had been unable to settle down to any steady
employment, preferring to devote himself to
some great invention. Eight years ago he began
working on this instrument, and had been
developing and perfecting it ever since.</p>

<p>&#8220;The proposition he made me was that I
should go into partnership with him to get the
seismaphone patented and before the public, he
furnishing the device, and I the money and
backing.</p>

<p>&#8220;We sat and talked for hours, and the morning
sun found us still in our chairs discussing
the immense possibilities of the invention.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would supersede the mails. Speaking-tubes,
telephones, telegraphs, and cables would
give way to it. In short, the inventor of such
an instrument would win for himself a name
greater than a Morse or an Edison, and the
fortune he could amass would exceed that of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the Vanderbilts, Goulds, and Rockefellers in the
country.</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin Bradley remained at my house all
that week, and had the best of everything that
money could buy. I secured a two weeks&#8217;
vacation from the patent office, and he and I
worked together every hour of that time.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day as a test he took one-half of the
seismaphone and went down the Potomac a
hundred and forty miles to Point Lookout,
while I stayed at home with the other instrument.
He had by use of the long-distance
telephone hired a man down there to keep
watch for the arrival of the boat he was coming
on, and given him instructions to telephone me
when it first hove in sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sent Nellie and the children out to Chevy
Chase for the day, and sat all the afternoon in
front of the telephone, with the seismaphone on
my knee. Several times I called to Bradley,
but he did not answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;About three o&#8217;clock, however, the &#8217;phone
rang; and, just as I had got connection, and
began talking with the man down at the Point,
I saw the little hammer of the seismaphone
vibrating, and, putting the instrument to my
ear, heard Martin Bradley say distinctly: &#8216;Have
just sighted the lighthouse, so get down to the
telephone for a message.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I turned to the telephone, and, sure enough,
the man at the other end of the wire was telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
me that the Petrel was in sight. As the boat
neared the shore, Bradley kept up a running
comment on events that took place.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We&#8217;re just pulling up the flag and firing a
salute,&#8217; he called; and scarcely did I catch his
words when from the telephone at my ear, as if
in echo, came the message, &#8216;They have just
run up a flag and are firing a salute.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;During the next week we tried every kind
of test imaginable with the seismaphone, and
there was not a flaw in its workings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was perfectly satisfied, and had started
proceedings to secure a patent, when the first
news of the recent trouble in China came; and
then, for two weeks, as you know, the various
legations were regularly slaughtered one day
and reported safe on the following.</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin Bradley was so excited that he
nearly forgot his seismaphone. In the course
of his wanderings he had lived for two years in
Northern China, and could talk the lingo like a
native, and was wild to go out there as a newspaper
correspondent.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day he came rushing to my room with
a copy of a morning paper in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;See that,&#8217; he cried excitedly, &#8216;this paper
says that Minister Conger was butchered in
cold blood June 24, and all the others of the
legation tortured to death by those yellow
devils. To-morrow if you buy a paper you will
read that they are safe and well. I tell you, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
am going to China to find out for myself the
truth of this matter, and when I do the world
shall know what is true and what is false.
They can put restrictions on the press, the telegraph,
and the cables, but they can&#8217;t restrict
Martin Bradley&#8217;s seismaphone.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Just think of the advertisement for the
invention, too,&#8217; he continued, getting more and
more excited. &#8216;Every reading person in the
world will know that the truth was finally obtained
through Martin Bradley, by means of
his greatest of all inventions, the seismaphone.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried to dissuade him, telling him of the
terrible risk he would run, but he would not
listen. He had lived in Peking for two years,
he said, and knew the city perfectly and the
customs and language of the people.</p>

<p>&#8220;He scraped together three hundred dollars
some way, the Lord only knows how, engaged a
berth for San Francisco, and inside three days
had made all preparations for the trip. When
I found that nothing I could say or do made
any difference, I gave up arguing and helped
him all I could.</p>

<p>&#8220;He knew what he wanted, though, so much
better than I that the only practical assistance
I gave him was of the financial kind. I arranged
credit for him at the British bank of
Hong Kong and Shanghai, and furnished all
the money needed for his traveling expenses.</p>

<p>&#8220;He purchased a complete Chinese disguise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
from a Washington costumer, and when one
night, before leaving, he appeared before me, a
long black cue hanging down his back, his
face stained, and chattering the disjointed dialect
he had learned during his two years&#8217; stay
in Peking, I felt a little hope that his scheme,
daring as it was, might succeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard from him several times each day,
all along the journey to San Francisco. Every
time he grew tired or lonesome he called me up
and told me of the country he was passing
through, while I kept him informed of what
was going on back here in Washington.</p>

<p>&#8220;For a whole week after he left San Francisco
I didn&#8217;t hear a word from him, though I
kept the seismaphone with me all the time, and
I was growing terribly worried, when one night
he signaled and I heard a weak voice saying,
&#8216;Oh, Lord, I&#8217;ve been so seasick, I didn&#8217;t care
for one while whether there was any such place
as China or not, and the thought of the seismaphone
never entered my head.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;After landing at Hong Kong he had to wait
two days before starting for Shanghai, but he
had to be resigned, and I never spent a pleasanter
afternoon in my life than that day when
I sat in the patent office and heard him describing
his trip about Victoria, that beautiful possession
of the British crown.</p>

<p>&#8220;He put on the megaphone attachment while
he was being wheeled about in a little jinrikisha,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and I could hear him talking to the coolie who
pulled it, and the squeaking of the wheels, as
plainly as the scratching of the pens over where
the clerks sat writing in my office.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the men at the office thought me crazy,
and I don&#8217;t know as I blame them, for of course
I hadn&#8217;t taken any of them into my confidence,
and it is rather an unusual sight to see a man
stop in the midst of a conversation with you,
put an unconnected receiver up to his ear,
then start talking apparently with the empty
air.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to take Nellie into the secret after a
while, though, for she, too, thought I must be
insane, and smuggled a couple of doctors up to
the house to dinner one night to watch me. I
told Bradley, and he submitted to the necessary
evil, as he called it.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, while he was in Shanghai, describing
one of the Chinese pagodas to me (at twelve
o&#8217;clock at night, mind you) I awakened her
and let her take the seismaphone, and you never
saw a more excited woman. She sat up all the
rest of the night, listening to Bradley and asking
him questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Towards morning I told her to throw in the
megaphone attachment, and the instrument was
laid up for four days, for she was so frightened
at the loudness of the voice that she dropped
the seismaphone, and two of the German silver
wires snapped. I was nearly crazy in fact for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the next few days, for I thought that the instrument
was ruined.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t tell whether Bradley was getting
my messages all right or not, and not a word
did I hear from him during all that time.</p>

<p>&#8220;After working all one night, however, I
succeeded in getting the wires fixed in the right
position and signaled to Bradley. Almost immediately
he answered and I heard him shouting:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What the devil has happened to you?
Have you been seasick too? I haven&#8217;t heard a
word from you for four days, and here I&#8217;ve
been sending you the most exciting kind of
messages. The disguise is working fine, and I
shall soon be in the city of Peking.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;That day I received a note from the head of
my department, telling me I was granted an indefinite
leave of absence, and I haven&#8217;t been in
the office since. They think me a lunatic, and
God knows I&#8217;ve been through enough to make
a maniac of any man.</p>

<p>&#8220;For three days more I didn&#8217;t get a message
from Bradley, and I had begun to fear that the
wires I had fixed weren&#8217;t right, when the bell
started to tinkle and I heard him signaling
faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;This is the last time you will ever hear from
me,&#8217; he said, and I noticed that he spoke as if
in great pain. &#8216;I worked my way into the city
last night, but got mixed up in a street fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
between the imperial troops and a crowd of
ruffians and was captured by the latter, who
found out my disguise.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t interrupt me,&#8217; he called faintly, for
I had uttered an exclamation of horror, and he,
seeing the hammer striking, thought I was trying
to speak to him, &#8216;for I can&#8217;t hear if you do.
They cut my ears off this morning, and filled
up the holes with hot wax.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There are three Englishmen and a Russian
here also, all of whom were captured and
brought in to-day.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He stopped for a few minutes, and I stood
cursing the helplessness of the whole thing.
There he was, thousands of miles away, being
tortured to death in some filthy Chinese den,
and I had to stand and listen calmly to his
voice, not able to raise a hand to aid him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I give you my share in the seismaphone,&#8217;
he continued after a while, &#8216;and I pray you may
be able to duplicate the half you now have, for
you will never see this one again. The two
instruments are exactly alike, except for the
wiring, and that you will have to get by experiment,
for all my data have been destroyed.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he must have fainted, for he stopped
suddenly, and I heard a voice, probably that of
one of the Englishmen, saying, &#8216;Poor devil, I
wish I could get to him; but they&#8217;ve tied me to
this ring in the wall, and I can&#8217;t move a foot.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear another word till late that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
night, when I woke up to find Nellie by my bed,
pale and trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t you hear him calling you?&#8217; she
gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;I seized the seismaphone, pressed the button,
and, in the silence of the night, I heard
Martin Bradley wailing, &#8216;Churchill&mdash;Churchill.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I spoke into the thing, so that his bell
would ring, and he would know that I was
listening.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good-by,&#8217; he called. &#8216;They are killing us
off one by one. The Russian, and two of the
Englishmen are dead now, and it&#8217;s my turn
next. They&#8217;ve just brought in an American,
and he told me on his fingers that the legations&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was as far as he got. I heard a terrible
screeching, which drowned out his voice;
and suddenly all was quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three times since that some of those heathen
have got hold of the thing; but that death
message of Bradley&#8217;s is the last English word
that has come over the seismaphone.</p>

<p>&#8220;The third time I heard them at it, I threw
in the megaphone attachment, and shouted as
loud as I could. Since then not a sound has
come from the instrument.</p>

<p>&#8220;I put the advertisement you saw in the
papers; but though hundreds of men have tried,
no one has been able to duplicate the part of
the seismaphone I now have. Some have refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
even to try, when I explained what was
wanted, for they thought me either crazy or
a fool.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hoped at first that some one might be able
to replace the loss, but now I know it cannot
be done. Bradley told me that it took him
three years to determine the distances at which
the wires had to be placed, and he alone knew
the principle on which the whole mechanism
depends.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one has ever been able to duplicate the
diaphragm. It is a curious alloy of copper,
zinc, and some other metal; but what that third
metal is, no one can determine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Churchill had finished his strange story; and
now he leaned back in his chair, his face gray
and set. Outside the noise of a great city
waking to another day&#8217;s life could be heard,
and somewhere in the house I heard a clock
slowly strike five.</p>

<p>I picked up the seismaphone from the table
and brought it over to the light. Then, even
as I held it in my hand, I saw the little hammer
begin vibrating rapidly, and heard the
tinkling of the bell.</p>

<p>But Randolph Churchill had heard that signal
too, and starting from his chair, he snatched
the instrument from my hands, and held it to
his ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only those damned heathen at it again,&#8221;
he groaned, and threw the thing on the table.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>In falling it must have pressed the tiny button,
which threw on the megaphone attachment.
The little bell began ringing again, and I started
back, trembling with a strange mixture of fear
and awe.</p>

<p>For, above the clatter of the wagons, and the
grinding of the cars as they climbed Fourteenth
Street hill, there, in that little room, fifteen
thousand miles from the Celestial Empire, I
heard a confused bable of many voices, howling
and cursing in the Chinese tongue.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_073.jpg"  alt="T"/>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE MAN on the shore stood
perfectly motionless watching
his companions of a few hours
before as they hastened down
the beach, launched their
boat, and pulled away toward
the huge ship some quarter
of a mile distant. He saw
them clamber on board; a few minutes later the
sails were run up, the ship headed off to the south,
and soon disappeared around a rocky promontory
which ran out into the ocean.</p>

<p>Then, overcome with the hopelessness and
helplessness of his position, The Man threw
himself on the sand cursing and moaning.</p>

<p>Three days before he had been first mate of
that ship, engaged in various profitable but decidedly
questionable undertakings. Now he
was alone, marooned on a deserted coral island,
over a hundred miles from any regular steamer
line. The mutiny which he had incited had
almost succeeded. But for that cursed cabin
boy who had listened at the key-hole and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
run to the Captain on the very eve of his success,
he would now be in command of the <small>NORSKA</small>,
and the sale of the five hundred blacks down in
the hold would have made him a rich man.
Well, the cabin boy would never tell any more
tales, he had at least had the satisfaction of assuring
himself of that before he was put in irons.</p>

<p>Yesterday, when he first heard the fate in store
for him, he had begged the Captain to have him
shot rather than leave him on that deserted isle.
But now, such is the perversity of man, though
death was easily within his reach, he did not
attempt to kill himself.</p>

<p>Indeed, after the first paroxysm of rage and
anger was over he gathered the few possessions
which had been left him and carried them back
out of reach of any high tide. The next day he
began building himself a rough house, and within
a week he was planning escape from his prison.</p>

<p>Then followed weary days and weeks in which
he spent the time hewing timber and fashioning
it into a rude boat. He had much time during
this enforced solitude to think over his past,
and the thoughts of it brought him little satisfaction.
For ten years he had lived the life of the
sea in its worst phases. He had been pirate,
ship-scuttler and slave-trader. He had murdered
and tortured the innocent. His life had
been only one long succession of crimes, and
still&mdash;he clung to it.</p>

<p>At the end of six weeks he had constructed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
boat in which he would attempt to reach the
nearest land&mdash;some three hundred miles away.
Then, one day, just before his departure, the
dream of his life was realized. While roaming
over the shore he stumbled into a lagoon which
was literally studded with pearls. For another
week he worked loading his boat with the precious
stones, and after some difficulty succeeded
in getting his cumbersome craft out to sea.</p>

<p>But the oars which he had hewn out being
too weak to have any appreciable effect on his
boat, he was completely at the mercy of the sea.
For days he drifted about, now driven north,
now south. The scanty supply of water which
he had brought with him soon gave out, and
then he suffered the tortures of the damned;
and, as if to mock his misery, the pearls, loosened
from the rough bags by the rocking of the
boat, rolled to and fro under his feet. About
the sides of the craft the water swarmed with
sharks, and several times in his delirium The
Man was on the point of ending his misery by
jumping overboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the use of all this struggle, anyway?&#8221;
he asked himself. Again the thoughts
of his lawless and wasted life came back to him.
He had never in all his life done one noble or
honorable deed; and should he ever land with
that cargo of wealth, he knew that the old dissipations
would be resumed wilder and more dissolute
with this new fortune.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>Impelled by some curious fancy, and true to
his gambler-like nature, he suddenly drew a coin
from his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I leave it to God to decide,&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;If I spin heads three times out of five I will
try and make for land; if not,&mdash;&#8221; He did not
finish the sentence, but he looked over the side
of the boat into the blue waters, and shivered
slightly as the white belly of a shark flashed in
the sunlight within three feet of him.</p>

<p>He knelt down on the bottom of the boat. It
was a most momentous question for him. He
held the little coin for a second, then spun it
nervously. As he lifted his trembling hand
he saw that the silver piece had fallen head
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not beyond pardon,&#8221; he whispered to
himself. &#8220;God wishes me to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more he spun the coin. Again it came
head up. The Man jumped to his feet joyfully.
The burning thirst was for the moment forgotten.
He was like a man whom a priest has
just absolved. God must surely wish him to
live; He would not torture him thus. For the
first time in his life a noble thought came to
The Man. The fortune which he had stumbled
upon he determined to use in works of charity.
He would atone for his misspent life.</p>

<p>Once more he knelt and confidently spun the
coin. To his horror it fell tails uppermost. He
seized it and spun it again. It wobbled to and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
fro like a drunken man for a few seconds, then
once more fell tails up.</p>

<p>The man raised a haggard face to heaven,
and for the first time since his childhood, prayed.
As he lowered his eyes he almost shouted for
joy; for, far on the western horizon, but rapidly
approaching, he saw the outlines of a ship. He
had been so intent on the game of life and death
he was playing that he had not seen the ship
till now it was plainly in view.</p>

<p>He sat for a few minutes and watched with
unbelieving eyes his approaching rescue, for the
ship was heading directly for him.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, he felt the piece of metal in
his hand. His fate was not yet decided. He
had a question of honor which God and he
were to decide. He spun the coin slowly, but
shut his eyes before it had ceased whirling.
Then he groped for the coin, and spread his
hand over it not daring to look at it.</p>

<p>He sat thus for a long time, the cold perspiration
standing out on his face. The ship
drew nearer and nearer, and he began to distinguish
forms on board. In a few minutes she
would be within hailing distance.</p>

<p>At last he reached down and picked up the
coin carefully, and holding it between both
palms, he arose and stepped to the side of the
boat, prepared for the first time in his life to
keep his word of honor. He looked down at
the heap of pearls at his feet, then at the rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
approaching ship. He saw that the men on
board had sighted him, and were preparing to
lower a boat.</p>

<p>Slowly he opened the fingers of the hand
covering the coin, and looked between with
scared eyes. Then he raised his right hand,
made the sign of the cross muttering &#8220;Thy will
be done,&#8221; and slipped quietly over the side of
the boat to the waiting mouths below.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR an Italian Prince, Fabriano
was exceedingly good company
for an American doctor.
He rode and shot like a cowboy,
kept a stud of seventeen
polo ponies, and had traveled
this little world from end to
end. Above all things, he was a connoisseur of
wines, and his cellars were stocked with cask
upon cask and tier upon tier of cobwebbed bottles
of rare old vintages. Indeed, it was indirectly
through this passion of Prince Fabriano
that Doctor Hardy made his acquaintance.
Hardy was consulting physician at the Protestant
Hospital in the Villa Betania, outside the
Porta Romana, and the Prince, on a flying visit
to the Tuscan capital to secure a vinous treasure,
and incidentally witness the annual festival
of Santa Croce, brought with him a touch of
Roman fever which caused his commitment to
the care of the American doctor. His illness
was short, but long enough to ripen the acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
with the doctor into a warm friendship,
resulting in an invitation to the physician
to visit the princely estate of Fabriano. In this
Umbrian fastness, where his ancestors had exercised
sovereign power, Fabriano was regarded
as the lord of the soil, by all but a few adherents
of a deposed house under the leadership of
Luigi di Folengo.</p>

<p>One evening, as Hardy went to the Prince&#8217;s
rooms for their usual smoke and game of cards,
he found the Prince sitting by the table, holding
a bottle of amber-colored liquid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not pull the cork, Fabriano, and let us
have something more than a sight of this richly-colored
fluid?&#8221; said the doctor in a bantering
tone.</p>

<p>To his surprise, the Prince answered quite
seriously, and with almost a shudder:</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not drink one sip of the wine that
comes in that flask&mdash;not even for the polo pony
Gustavo that we saw in the Royal stables last
week, and you know how much I coveted that
little beast.&#8221;</p>

<p>A second look showed Hardy that the bottle
was of peculiar shape and peculiarly stoppered;
and he asked the question which he saw the
Prince was ready to answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember the trip to Florence to
which I owe the pleasure of your acquaintance?
Well, I had another reason beside my interest
in the Santa Croce festival. You have heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the Monastery of La Certosa, out on the Galluzzo
road, beyond your hospital? The government
had abolished it, and there was a store of
valuable wine to be put up at auction, including
a few bottles of Pantinelli. Fate has seemed to
be against my getting any of that wine, until
to-day. I have tried for years to get one small
bottle, but never yet have tasted it. Pantinelli
was a rich old banker in Genoa, who owned a
vineyard on the sunny slopes of the Riviera di
Ponente. He never sold his wine, but presented
it to his friends; and as he was a cousin of
Luigi di Folengo, of whose hatred for me I have
already told you, he, naturally, never included
me in his list of beneficiaries.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was nothing peculiar in the appearance
of Pantinelli&#8217;s wine, but it was invariably
put up in bottles just like this. He was an
eccentric old fellow, and always corked his bottles
by means of this peculiar device, which he
claimed to have invented. He gave as a reason
for his oddity the belief that if he used the customary
seal his friends would keep his beverage
for years unopened, without discovering its flavor,
and that he meant them to test its superiority
at once on receipt. He seems to have
relied on his friends themselves to prevent the
fraudulent substitution of another wine, which
would, in his queer bottles, have brought an
enormous price. However, any one lucky enough
to receive a bottle of the famous beverage usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
followed the old man&#8217;s request to the letter,
and drank it the same day.</p>

<p>&#8220;This afternoon, while you slept, a messenger
brought this bottle with a message from
Luigi di Folengo, expressing the wish that we
might live in amity hereafter, and begging the
acceptance of a gift which he believed that I,
more than any one else in all Italy would appreciate,
a flask of genuine Pantinelli.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I do not absolutely know that the wine
he sent is poisoned, but I think I know Folengo
pretty well, and I am going to try an experiment
this evening which I should like to have
you witness. I answered him immediately to
the effect that his overtures were gladly welcomed,
and that on my part I should be pleased
to give him an important appointment in my
service, and hand him the papers to-night. I
ended by telling him that to-morrow, seeking
out a quiet spot, I should enjoy my Pantinelli to
the last drop.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince put the bottle away in a sideboard
and produced from a desk a folded paper as
Count Luigi di Folengo was announced. He
was a swarthy person, with a saber cut across
one cheek, and a droop to the eyelid which, to
Dr. Hardy, was singularly unprepossessing. The
physician highly approved his friend&#8217;s course in
leaving the Pantinelli untasted.</p>

<p>The conversation was general for a few moments
after the guests had been introduced, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
then the Prince, taking out the queer-shaped
flask, silently placed it upon the table as he
handed Folengo his appointment. Dr. Hardy
watched the man as he stared at the bottle, half-guessing
what was to come. Folengo mumbled
words of thanks for the paper, but his eyes
never left the wine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you looking longingly at your present of
the afternoon,&#8221; said the Prince pleasantly, &#8220;and
instead of selfishly drinking it all by myself to-morrow,
I will be generous. Of course this
wine has not the novelty of charm to you
that it has to others unrelated to its famous
grower, but no one could get enough of such a
drink; and, in honor of our new-formed friendship,
you must drink my health in one small
glass of the famed wine of Pantinelli.&#8221;</p>

<p>He poured out a brimming glass and set it
down in front of Luigi di Folengo, who sat shaking
like a leaf, his drooping eyelid fluttering with
strong excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am to play to-night, with my friend the
doctor here, a game for very high stakes, so I
must keep my head clear; but to-morrow you
may think of me as steeped in Pantinelli&#8217;s generous
vine juice.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the Prince spoke the last sentence he took
from the table-drawer a handsome gold-mounted
revolver, which he held up to the light so that
glittering rays darted from its polished barrel
as he said to the trembling Luigi, &#8220;I also wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to present you this pistol, with which I have
never missed a shot, and which has sent more
than one of my enemies down the long road.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Fabriano spoke the man&#8217;s eyes anxiously
searched the room for a means of escape,
and finally came back to the calm face of the
Prince. He glanced from the heavy amber
liquor before him to the shining weapon with
which Fabriano lovingly toyed, and then with a
quiet heroism which Hardy could not help but
admire, he raised the glass to his lips and
drained it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_086fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption"><b>&#8220;And, raising the glass to his lips, he drained it.&#8221;</b>
(See page 86.)</p>

<p>He sat there for a minute or two, gazing stupidly
at the empty glass. Then, of a sudden,
he began to tremble violently; his teeth chattered,
and great beads of perspiration stood upon
his forehead. On his lips there came a yellowish
foam, and he started to his feet, clawing at
his breast as if it were on fire, while a hoarse,
cackling noise came from his throat. Dr. Hardy
knew that the man must be suffering terribly,
and, guilty as he believed him to be, could only
pity.</p>

<p>Rocking to and fro, Folengo threw himself
upon the floor, where he lay writhing and twisting
in his death agony. His face turned black,
and his eyes started from his head, like those of
a strangled man. After that he lay quite still.</p>


<p>Dr. Hardy stooped and felt for the man&#8217;s
heart. There was not the trace of a beat. He
turned to the Prince, who had sat through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>whole scene with a smiling face, and said, &#8220;You
are amply avenged, Prince Fabriano. That man
died the most terrible death I have witnessed in
twenty years of practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fabriano, still smiling strangely, poured out
two more glasses of the wine which the dead
man had just drunk. &#8220;So be it with all assassins!&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Drink to the downfall of my
enemy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; answered Hardy drily,
thinking the ghastly joke was being carried too
far; &#8220;life has still a few attractions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, as you will,&#8221; replied the Prince carelessly.
&#8220;Then I must drink alone,&#8221; and he
emptied the glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are missing something choice,&#8221; he
continued, wiping his lips. &#8220;That wine has
been in my cellars for fifty years. The stuff
our late friend sent is safely locked away for
analysis, together with a poisoned dagger and
an infernal machine, both of which, I believe, I
owe to him or his followers. If you were coroner
in this case, what would your verdict be&mdash;death
from a guilty conscience, supplemented by
a vivid imagination? Come, I believe it&#8217;s my
first deal this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph1">THE STRANGEST FREAK.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_091.jpg"  alt="S"/>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;SNAKES in a den, like bees in
a hive, and she eats &#8217;em
alive. That&#8217;s what she does,
ladies and gentlemen. She
bites the head off, eats the
body, and throws the tail
away. And it costs you
but ten cents, one dime, the tenth part of a dollar,
to see Bosko.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was just outside the main side-show connected
with Poole Brothers&#8217; Royal Roman Hippodrome
and Three Ring Circus, and the big
tent had not yet opened for the afternoon&#8217;s performance.</p>

<p>Stetson, manager of the freaks and chief
announcer for all the special shows, had just succeeded,
by beating on a large iron triangle, in
attracting a majority of the people standing
about the grounds. Behind him on a raised
platform was a huge box-like pen which rose to
about the height of a man&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>Gaudy placards and pictures adorning the
upper part of this platform stated that within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
could be seen Bosko&mdash;the Strangest Freak
Ever Born to Live&mdash;a human snake-eater.
One of the pictures represented a creature
clothed principally in long black hair and a ferocious
expression squatting at the entrance of a
large cave. In one hand, or paw, was a decapitated
giant rattlesnake which she was in the act
of devouring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Esau, that&#8217;s her first name; Bosko, that&#8217;s
her last name; and she eats live snakes,&mdash;rattlesnakes,
copperheads, yellow backs, and Gila
monsters. That&#8217;s what she eats, that&#8217;s what
she lives on,&#8221; shouted the manager.</p>

<p>The country people, anxious as ever to throw
away the money so hardly wrung from their
stubborn hill farms, crowded each other in their
eagerness to be first on the platform. The box-like
pen was about ten feet long by four feet
wide, and soon between thirty and forty people
had crowded about the rail, and were peering
open-mouthed over the edge.</p>

<p>On the bottom of the pen was crouched a
dark-skinned Something lazily rolling its head
from side to side. This Something wore a brown
canvas skirt which came to the knees, and a sort
of loose coat or jacket over the shoulder. On
her head, and hanging down over her eyes, was
a long, black mane of hair, which but few of the
yokels about recognized as a wig.</p>

<p>But crawling over this swarthy, thick-lipped
creature were the things which caused the exclamations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
on the part of the bystanders. Over
the body of Bosko, under, beside and behind her,
twined and wriggled dozen upon dozen of twisting,
writhing snakes. They coiled and uncoiled
over her black legs, running out their little
forked tongues spitefully. The sun beat down
fiercely overhead, and swarms of flies settled
down on every part of the evil smelling pen.</p>

<p>Stetson made way for himself at one end of
the rail, and began a more detailed description.
&#8220;Before you, ladies and gentlemen, you see, as
I just told you, the strangest freak ever born to
live, Bosko, Esau Bosko, the human snake eater.
The medical fraternity declare that she is part
snake, part woman. Part snake because she has
to kill her own food before she eats it. When
first captured in Australia, Bosko was living in a
cave like you see in the pictures outside, subsisting
entirely on the most poisonous kinds of
snakes. It is about the time she usually feeds,
and if you watch carefully you may see how this
strangest of all freaks obtains its food.&#8221;</p>

<p>As if taking its cue from the manager&#8217;s last
remark, the Thing in the pen ceased rolling its
head, and began running about on all fours,
making low guttural noises in its throat, and
feeling first one then another of the reptiles.</p>

<p>Suddenly it seized a small rattler, and taking
it firmly in both hands just below the head gave
a quick twisting movement. There was a sound
of rending flesh and the head was flung to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
floor. Then taking the remaining stump, Bosko
drew back the skin as if peeling a banana, and
buried her teeth in the still quivering flesh.</p>

<p>Most of the spectators turned away at this
point and left the platform. Several looked
rather white and seemed not to feel particularly
well. Others, however, of a stronger constitution,
or of lesser sensibilities, stayed on, anxious
to see if the show was a &#8220;fake,&#8221; and if the
mouthful would be spit out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Stetson at the foot of the platform,
was shouting, &#8220;Go where they all go, see what
they all see. Bosko, the human snake eater,
that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re all looking at. That&#8217;s what
they&#8217;re all interested in. Yellow backed rattlers,
that&#8217;s what Bosko is eating to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something so disgusting about the
show, and since each man who saw the freak
advised his neighbors not to do likewise, those
same neighbors, being human, immediately purchased
tickets, and the railing about the pen of
Bosko was lined with wide-eyed, fascinated spectators
till the show in the main tent was over
for the afternoon.</p>

<p>Then Murphy, one of the attendants, came
to the pen and threw a cover over the top.
Almost instantly a small trap door in the bottom
of the box opened, and Bosko disappeared from
the den of snakes. Twenty minutes later a
short, thickset negro of a remarkably unpleasant
cast of features was walking unsteadily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
about the grounds consuming cigarettes without
number.</p>

<p>It cost the manager of the Royal Roman
Hippodrome one dollar and seventy cents a day
in money, a few inexpensive snakes, and an unlimited
amount of cheap whiskey to present to
the gullible public Bosko, the &#8220;Strangest Freak
Ever Born to Live.&#8221;</p>

<p>It had been put on by Poole Brothers as an
experiment three months before, when the show
split up at Boston. The best part of the side
show, including Bobo, the Wild Man from Borneo,
Herman the Ossified Boy, and the Sacred
White Elephant, had followed the best part of
the circus and gone through Rhode Island and
Connecticut, while the remainder was sent up
through Northern New England.</p>

<p>The side show was thus left a little short of
first-class freaks. So Stetson, with his customary
ingenuity, had arranged for an entirely
new sensation,&mdash;Bosko, a human snake-eater,&mdash;and
the attraction, which was only an experiment
at first, was now one of the best drawing cards.</p>

<p>Like all other good things in this world, however,
it had its disadvantages. Bosko had to be
watched constantly. Twice he had smuggled
the little black bottle which was his constant
companion, when not before the public, into the
pen with him. Fortunately, no one had seen
him taking surreptitious pulls at it either time,
but there was always the possibility.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>Stetson had also been alarmed, during his
preliminary harangue to the crowd one day, to
see smoke issuing from the top of the pen, and,
on looking in, found Bosko stealthily puffing
away on a cigarette. Murphy was quickly dispatched
to the little trap-door in the bottom of
the cage, and the smoking immediately ceased.</p>

<p>To be sure, it took more and more whiskey
every day to get Bosko &#8220;keyed up&#8221; to that state
when he would consent to go on with the part;
but whiskey was cheap, especially the brand furnished
by Poole Brothers, so there was no kick
from the powers above. They realized that this
particular impersonator of Bosko couldn&#8217;t last
very long&mdash;a quart of raw whiskey a day is
a terrible strain for any man&#8217;s nerves, even a
negro&#8217;s; so they &#8220;indulged&#8221; the snake-eater.</p>

<p>The only thing that worried Stetson was the
fear that perhaps Bosko wouldn&#8217;t be able to
keep up the part till the Amalgamated Shows
came together in the fall. He had watched the
&#8220;nigger&#8221; a good deal of late, and saw certain
unmistakable signs. He was the only man in
the show who knew the exact amount of the
poison that Bosko drank every day before assuming
his part, so he was in a position to read
those signs very correctly.</p>

<p>The first trouble came just after the circus
struck Vermont. In the interval between the
close of the afternoon and the beginning of the
evening performance, Bosko went up street at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
a small town called Montpelier, and stayed till
after time for the evening show to begin.</p>

<p>Murphy and the camp doctor, Foley, were
sent for him, and finally located him in the town
jail. He had bought some alcohol at the local
agency, prepared some &#8220;splits,&#8221; and drunk about
a pint of the stuff. A few minutes later he had
developed an acute attack of something so terrifying
to some street urchins, who found him in
a back street, that they had run to the only
officer in town, and informed him that there was
a mad man loose.</p>

<p>After a certain amount of &#8220;fixing&#8221; with the
high sheriff, who was also constable, health
officer, and game warden, the doctor was finally
allowed to take Bosko back to the circus
grounds. But the &#8220;Strangest Freak&#8221; was not
on exhibition that evening, being too busily engaged
with snakes of his own, not furnished by
the management of the Royal Roman Hippodrome.</p>

<p>During the next week several changes were
tried in regard to Bosko. He was given a decrease
in pay and a decrease in liquor, as a punishment
for his misdemeanor. This not being
exactly what you might call a success, he was
given a raise in pay, the decrease in whiskey
still being continued.</p>

<p>Fluctuations in salary proved, however, to
have no effect on Bosko, so long as he was
not allowed to spend the money according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
his own lights. The arrangement which was
finally settled upon was, therefore, a total discontinuance
of pay and an increase in whiskey.</p>

<p>Three days after the first trouble, even while
an instalment of the afternoon&#8217;s crowd was
eagerly watching the snake-eater and listening
to Stetson&#8217;s description of him, Bosko was suddenly
visited by his other collection of snakes.</p>

<p>Carried away by the violence of the attack,
but apparently from force of habit remembering
his part, he gave an exhibition that day in the
destruction of his companions of the pen, which,
though rather expensive to Messrs. Poole Brothers,
nevertheless made Bosko&#8217;s lifelong reputation
as a snake-eater.</p>

<p>Stetson, with true managerial instinct, made
the most of the attack, and the receipts at
Bosko&#8217;s platform on that day rivalled those of
the main show. Admissions were put up to a
quarter, but still the crowd which blocked the
railing refused to diminish.</p>

<p>Such was the success of that day&#8217;s terrible
performance that Bosko&#8217;s fame quickly spread
throughout the entire state, and for the next
month he proved one of the brightest and most
remunerative &#8220;stars&#8221; that Poole Brothers had
exhibited since the old days of the Hindoo
Leper.</p>

<p>Nor did he have to live on the reputation of
that one performance alone, for towards the last
of the month the attacks were of almost daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
occurrence. But that state of affairs could not
continue long.</p>

<p>The last public appearance of the &#8220;Strangest
Freak&#8221; was in Concord, N. H., and those who
witnessed the ravings of the Australian snake-eater
on that day saw something which they did
not forget for many a year.</p>

<p>The next day Bosko was too ill to leave his
bed, and a week later he died, still fighting his
foes, and wailing piteously, &#8220;Take &#8217;em away; I
can&#8217;t eat &#8217;em all. There&#8217;s too many of &#8217;em, and
they&#8217;re too big. There&#8217;s hundreds of &#8217;em. Take
&#8217;em away, I say. They&#8217;re in my hair, they&#8217;re
choking me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The snake-eating attraction had to be discontinued
after that, for though Stetson made some
very flattering offers to several of the colored
cooks, hostlers, and helpers connected with the
show, no one seemed to aspire to the position.
Some few had seen the negro the last night,
and news of that kind travels fast.</p>

<p>The public, however, clamored for a snake-eater.
They had heard such blood-curdling
reports of the freak which had passed through
Vermont and New Hampshire, that many were
the complaints made to the management for not
bringing out their whole show.</p>

<p>The circus, being, above all things, an institution
catering to the public&#8217;s wishes, made heroic
efforts. Stetson was sent on a special trip to
New York, and spent most of the time slumming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
He returned soon after with a negro
well past middle age and almost blind, but with
a strong affinity for gin.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t much of a sight for anyone who had
ever seen the creator of the part of Bosko, this
stupid, muttering old man, who sometimes went
to sleep during performances; but his predecessor
had made the reputation, and he simply lived
on it, staying gloriously drunk six days out of the
week.</p>

<p>As for Poole Brothers, they couldn&#8217;t complain.
The attraction had already netted them ten times
what they had ever expected to get out of it.
And, remembering how tame had been the original
snake-eater when he first took the part, they
gave Stetson <i>carte blanche</i> in the matter of gin,
and trusted that, perhaps, in time the precedent
which Bosko had established might be repeated.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I MET him the first time in a
low <i>cabaret</i> in the Rivola, the
cheapest quarter of Paris.
How did I come there? Perhaps
I am a student of the
lower classes, and was pursuing
my study there. Perhaps&mdash;but
never mind, it makes no difference
how I came there or who or what I am. This
is not my story, it concerns the Prophet only.</p>

<p>As I sat watching the changing crowd I heard
some men at the next table talking of a man
sitting over in a corner who once had a fortune
that he had won by forecasting events, but whose
gift had left him suddenly, and now his money
was gone and he was without a friend.</p>

<p>I looked over toward the corner curiously.
Leaning against one of the supporting pillars of
the low-studded room, I saw a pale, weary-looking
man. I did not need to look at the glass on
the table to learn what he was drinking. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
recognized by that sallow skin, the frequent
convulsive starts, and the little catch in his
breathing, an habitual <i>absintheur</i>.</p>

<p>He sat apart from the others, and no one
spoke to him during the evening. Occasionally
he ordered drink, and then sat for several minutes
watching lovingly the green, opalescent
lights in the liquid before him.</p>

<p>I had forgotten all about him, when, chancing
to glance in his direction a few minutes later, I
saw that an altercation was taking place. The
Prophet was having an argument with the
waiter over the payment of his bill. I saw
him thrust his hand in his pockets, searching
desperately for a coin, but in vain.</p>

<p>Hoping that perhaps I might learn something
of the man&#8217;s story, I arose, and, sitting down
opposite him, I threw out a few coins, telling the
waiter to take out the payment of my friend&#8217;s
bill, and to bring us a bottle of Vie de
Anise.</p>

<p>Do you think he was offended? You do not
know the action of that insidious poison. Honor,
ambition, everything, are but as baubles to the
devotee of absinthe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vie de Anise, did you say?&#8221; he asked,
eagerly, leaning over the table. &#8220;It is years
since I have tasted any of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat with him until nearly midnight; but try
as I would I could not draw the man out. Several
times I skillfully directed the conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in the desired channel, but each time he as
skillfully eluded me.</p>

<p>He was in terrible condition. His nerves
were completely shattered. He could scarcely
sit still for a minute; and his hand shook so, as
he raised the glass to his lips, that the green
liquor spilled and ran over on to the sawdust
floor. At last, as it was nearly time for the
place to close, I asked him point-blank to tell me
the story of his life.</p>

<p>He looked at me strangely. I do not know,
it may have been the drink, but someway he did
not look like the man I had sat down with a few
hours before. The tired, weary look had completely
disappeared, his face was flushed, and his
eyes were as bright as a child&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to-night,&#8221; he said, in answer to my request,
&#8220;but sometime. Sometime when I can
prove to you my right to the title, I will tell
you why they used to call me The Prophet.
For, sometime, the gift will come back to me
again.&#8221; He leaned over the table and looked
me full in the face with those unnaturally bright
eyes as he whispered: &#8220;It is coming back soon,
I can feel it. The false prophet shall redeem
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not see the man again for many weeks,
for I was busy with other things. One night,
however, I dropped into the place and seated
myself in a corner. I had scarcely taken off my
gloves when I felt some one touch me on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
shoulder, and, as I looked up, I saw the Prophet
standing near. I scarcely recognized him, he
was so changed. His cheeks had great sunken
places in them, and the skin had a waxy and
corpse-like appearance. But his eyes were
brighter than ever before as he said, eagerly:</p>

<p>&#8220;It has come back again, as I told you it
would. To-night I will tell you the story you
wished to know before. Where have you been
so long?&#8221;</p>

<p>I told him that I had been very busy since I
last saw him, and, ordering a bottle of his favorite
drink, I waited with interest for what I felt must
prove a strange and interesting tale. He waited
till the liquor came, and, after taking a deep
draught, he told me the following story:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have probably heard the men here
telling how I used to be a prophet and could
foretell events, and that once I failed. What
you have not heard, though, is how I came to
fail; but I will tell you to-night. I did not
always have the gift, neither did I study and
cultivate it. It came to me as an inspiration,&mdash;and
I abused that gift,&#8221; he added, sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first time was just before de Arnault
was killed. As I sat at this very table drinking,
a peculiar feeling came over me, a kind of
exaltation. I seemed to be drifting out of myself
and to have no part with my surroundings.
Then, gradually, I began to see a great crowd
in a public square. A man was sitting in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
carriage near the Arch of Triumph, reviewing
some troops. I could not see his face, for there
was a mist about it. Suddenly, out of the
crowd, I saw a man working his way toward
the carriage. He reached it, and, drawing a
revolver from his pocket, he fired three shots
full at the breast of the man in the carriage.
Then the mist which had been about his face
cleared, and I recognized the Count de Arnault.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I came to myself the waiter was
standing by my chair asking if I were ill. I
must have been acting queerly, for as I went
out everyone looked at me curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someway, strange as it probably seems to
you, I did not pay much attention to the vision,
for my brain is not exactly right, and I see
many things after I have been drinking which
would frighten most men. Imagine my horror
a week later, however, when, as the Count was
reviewing the Imperial troops at the Place de la
Concorde, I saw enacted in reality what I had
seen in my vision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, for a year, I had those strange visitations,
during which future events were revealed
to me exactly as they were to occur. I gained
a reputation here in the Rivola, for during the
Franco-Prussian war I foretold the defeat of the
army at Saarbruck, the retreats at Weissenburg
and Worth, the capitulation of Metz, and the
fatal disaster at Sedan. It was this war that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
was my ruin. The money which before I could
scarcely scrape together came to me now by
the purse. I was consulted on every great occasion,
and my prophecies were paid for in
gold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you realize what a gift I had?&#8221; he cried,
becoming excited. &#8220;I could have done anything,
been anything I wished. My fame extended
beyond the humble Rivola. I was
sought after by all classes, from the lowest to
the highest.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped and remained silent for several
minutes, then he began again bitterly. &#8220;And
because for two long years I never did one
worthy thing with the money I earned so easily,&mdash;because
I made that gift a curse instead of
a blessing,&mdash;God took it from me. The
money that I had saved melted away, and I was
soon back again where I had been before, for I
would not lie to the people. That is, at first I
would not lie to them; but when for two more
years I waited and not a vision came to me, I
became desperate. I needed money terribly,
and I thirsted for my former fame. So, just
before the treaty of peace was laid before the
National Assembly by Thiers, I told the people
that it would not be accepted, and you know how
it came out on March 1. My old patrons, who
had taken my advice and staked much money
on my prophecy, were furious. I was even in a
worse position than I had been before. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
two years that I had foretold events correctly
counted for nothing. I had failed once, and
nobody would ever believe me again. I was a
False Prophet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not know how I have lived since
then, and I will not tell you. The few sous I
have picked up doing menial tasks have been
spent here, you know how. Sometimes I have
been for days without food, but I could always
manage to get a little liquor. But now at last
it has come back again. I have a chance to
redeem myself, and I shall make such a different
use of the gift than I did before. I have
had another vision. France is about to undergo
another great change. She shall&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, leaned forward against
the table, and began to breathe heavily. His
eyes lost their bright look, the pupils narrowed
to needle points and took on the peculiar, dull
appearance of a hypnotized man. Then over
his face there stole a look of fear. He turned
and glanced toward the bar. Involuntarily I
followed his glance, but there were only a
couple of sailors talking together. I turned
again to my companion. The look of fear had
given way to one of absolute horror, and he had
thrown up his arm as if to ward off a blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that, my God, not that,&#8221; he muttered,
&#8220;just when I was to have redeemed my honor!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prophet was having another vision, of
that I was sure. But what could be the impending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
disaster which could bring on such a
look of horror as that?</p>

<p>Then, without a word of warning, he was
himself again, and turned to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is fate,&#8221; he said, sadly, &#8220;and it must be
borne; but it is very hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited several minutes, trying to collect
himself, then he began again in a low tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had my last vision. Soon&mdash;I know
not when&mdash;but I must die. And such a
death!&#8221; He shuddered and threw up his hand
again, involuntarily, as he had done before.
&#8220;As you and I sit here together at this table, a
man will come into the place. He will mistake
you for an enemy of his, and will try to kill
you; but do not fear, he will not succeed.
Promise me,&#8221; he pleaded, &#8220;that you will take
care of me when it is all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>I tried to make him leave the place, to promise
never to come back again if he thought
there were any such danger; but he only shook
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no use, it is fate; and who are we to
try to interfere with the will of God? I tell
you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped. Again that look of fear began
to come over his face, and I turned to see the
cause of his alarm, for he was not in any trance
this time.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t turn round!&#8221; he
cried.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>But it was too late. As I turned, I saw,
standing by the bar, a man almost a giant in
form. As I looked, he chanced to glance in the
mirror behind the bar. He caught my eye,
and, in a second, turned and started for our
table. Never have I seen such a look of hate
on a human face. As he neared our table, he
drew a huge knife from his belt.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have found you at last!&#8221; he cried.
He reached our table and raised that terrible
knife, while I sat there, staring stupidly at him,
paralyzed with fear.</p>

<p>The arm descended, but, before the knife
could reach me, the Prophet had leaped from
his chair and thrown himself in the way. Once
more I saw that pitiful little gesture of defense.
I tried to look away, but could not. I had not
moved a muscle since I had first seen the
murderer.</p>

<p>With a blow strong enough to have felled an
ox, the cruel knife sank deep into the Prophet&#8217;s
neck, described a circular motion, and came out
on the other side, severing the head completely
from the body.</p>

<p>The brute, horrified at what he had done,
dropped the knife and fled from the place.
Then, as if released from the spell which had
held me, I came to myself.</p>

<p>I do not know how I did it, but, picking up
that ghastly thing from the floor, I rose and
told the men assembled of the prophecy which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the dead man had made to me a short time
before. It may not seem much to you, but I
felt that I owed it to the Prophet, to give him
back the place among those people which he
had formerly held. And to-day, in the Rivola,
his name is honored as it was in the old days.
It was an awful price to pay, but he paid it;
and his reward was, that the stigma of false was
forever removed from his name and memory.</p>

<p>The Prophet had redeemed himself.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_115.jpg"  alt="I"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN one corner of his solitary
cell, with face buried in his
hands, sat Jean Lescaut, wife
poisoner, waiting for the morrow
on which he would expiate
his crimes.</p>

<p>Each hour as the sentry
made his rounds, he saw the
prisoner sitting in that same hopeless attitude of
despair. A month before when he first heard his
sentence he had raved and fought impotently.
Night after night, and day after day he had
paced his narrow cell like a caged animal, but
now that was over. Already the shadow of
the doom which was so near had fallen upon
him.</p>

<p>Presently there was a sound of footsteps, and
the prisoner heard two people in conversation
coming down the corridor. But he did not stir;
events of that day had no interest for him: he
was to be electrocuted on the morrow. The
steps stopped outside his cell, and he heard the
attendant saying, &#8220;I am sorry, Doctor Van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Horne, but I can give you only an hour. Orders
are orders, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The heavy barred door swung open, was closed
and locked again, and the turnkey walked away.
Jean Lescaut looked up wearily and without
curiosity. He saw a tall clerical gentleman
regarding him intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jean Lescaut,&#8221; began the stranger, stepping
close to the prisoner, &#8220;I have come here to-day
to offer you the only thing on earth which you
care for&mdash;liberty.&#8221;</p>

<p>A quick flush of color dyed the prison pallor
of the man in irons, then as quickly faded
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to offer this to you,&#8221; the doctor
continued, &#8220;not because I think you innocent
of the crime of which you were convicted, not
because I have any friendship for you, or because
I desire to defeat justice. The proposition
I make you is purely in the interest of
science. Have you ever been hypnotized?&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever seen anyone in such a condition?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lescaut nodded wearily. All this talk irritated
him. He wished that the man would
stop looking at him so intently and questioning
him so much. It reminded him of that other
day in the court room when the lawyer for the
prosecution had looked at him in just such a
way, and asked him so many questions that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
had become confused and told many things that
he had never intended to tell.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you have seen it done, so much the
better. You have probably seen persons put
under this influence and then undergo tests
which you know would be a physical impossibility
for them to endure otherwise. I have
myself given subjects arsenic, telling them it was
sugar, and they felt no bad effects. I have
also burned with hot irons and thrust pins into
the flesh of such persons without their feeling
any pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what I have to propose to you, Jean
Lescaut, is this,&mdash;to-morrow at noon you are
to go to the electric chair where 1800 volts of
electricity will be sent through your body.
At eleven o&#8217;clock to-morrow I will come to your
cell and put you into an hypnotic sleep. You
will go to the chair, show all the symptoms and
effects of a person electrocuted, and you will
apparently be dead. In reality, however, you
will only be asleep. And, as I can easily obtain
your body from the prison doctor on the pretense
of using it for dissection purposes, I can
then awaken you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner leaned over and clutched the
doctor&#8217;s arm so tightly that he winced. &#8220;And
what then?&#8221; he whispered eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, as I have just said, I will awaken
you. I will have proven that a certain theory
of mine is correct or false, and you will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
obtained your liberty, for I shall not hinder you
from going where you will after the experiment
is over. But I must first try and see if I can
get control of you. You may not be susceptible
to my influence.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour later the turnkey came to inform
Van Horne that his hour had expired, and the
preliminary trial must have been a success, for
there was a smile of triumph on the doctor&#8217;s
face as he bade the prisoner good day.</p>

<p>Next day an hour previous to the time set
for the electrocution of Jean Lescaut, Doctor
Van Horne again visited the prisoner in his
cell. At twelve o&#8217;clock two attendants came
and conducted him to the fatal room. The
reporters and prison officials present remarked
on the calmness of the doomed man. He walked
to the chair without assistance, and submitted
to the strapping down and adjusting of the
sponges and electrodes without a tremor.</p>

<p>When all was ready the warden stepped to
the side of the chair. &#8220;Jean Lescaut,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;I am about to give the signal for you to be
sent into eternity. Have you anything to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man in the chair shook his head. The
warden stepped back out of sight and made a
sign to an assistant behind the screen. A
switch was thrown on and the voltmeter registered
that nearly 2000 volts of electricity were
passing through the hooded figure in the chair.
The warden held his watch in his hand, glancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
first at it, then at Lescaut. At the end of
eight seconds he made another sign, and the
man at the switch cut off the current.</p>

<p>The prison doctor stepped up from one side
and examined the body carefully. &#8220;Justice is
satisfied. I pronounce Jean Lescaut dead,&#8221; he
said solemnly, and motioning to two of the attendants,
he bade them carry away the body.</p>

<p>That night, in a dissecting room in the suburbs
of Albany, a crowd of scientific men assembled
at the invitation of Doctor Van Horne
to witness an important experiment. No one
knew what that experiment was to be; but
every one had accepted the invitation, for Van
Horne had a high reputation among his colleagues.</p>

<p>When the last expected guest had arrived,
the doctor made a few remarks to the company.
&#8220;I have invited you here to-night,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to
witness an experiment, which, if I am not mistaken,
I have the distinction of being the first
to attempt. I have to-day taken the law in my
own hands; but, if the theory on which I have
been working is correct, justice will not be deprived
of its victim.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day, one hour previous to his electrocution,
I hypnotized Jean Lescaut, the man who
poisoned his wife, strangled his child, and who
was sentenced to death last July. While under
my influence I told him that the current of
electricity which would be sent through his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
body would not kill him, but would only put
him to sleep, from which to-night I would
awaken him.</p>

<p>&#8220;After he was pronounced dead by the prison
doctor, I secured his body for dissection, and
have had it brought into the next room. Now,
if a theory on which I have been working for
the last year is correct, the impression which
I left on his brain, has kept that electricity
from producing death; and, at my command,
Jean Lescaut, though to all appearances a
corpse, will speak to us to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a stir of expectation among the
doctors present as Van Horne stepped into the
adjoining room. Presently he returned wheeling
a light operating chair, over which a sheet
was thrown.</p>

<p>&#8220;If everything should not happen in accordance
with my theory, of course what happens
to-night is under the seal of the profession,&#8221; he
observed quietly, as he lifted the cloth. &#8220;I
wish you all to examine this body and state
whether or not the man is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctors crowded about the figure in the
chair, and used every known means to detect
the presence of life in the body. At the end of
ten minutes every one declared that Jean Lescaut
was dead, that it was impossible to discover
a sign of life.</p>



<p>Dr. Van Horne pushed the operating chair
with its strange burden directly under the electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
light, turning the reflector so that the
strong rays fell full on the pallid upturned face.
He passed his hands lightly and rapidly over the
man&#8217;s temples.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_120fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption"><b>&#8220;He turned the reflector so that the rays fell on the
pallid, upturned face.&#8221;</b> (See page 121.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Jean Lescaut,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;can you
hear me?&#8221; There was no sign of life on the
part of the sleeper, and Van Horne repeated
his question, speaking more sharply.</p>

<p>Then, hardened though they were by numberless
horrible scenes at the operating table,
many of the doctors shuddered; for, slowly,
indeed so slowly that the motion was barely
perceptible, the figure in the chair began to
nod its head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer me,&#8221; cried Van Horne, raising his
voice, and taking both the man&#8217;s hands in his
own. One of the doctors, younger than the
others, raised the window and thrust his head
out into the cold air. The room was becoming
oppressive.</p>

<p>Slowly Jean Lescaut&#8217;s mouth opened. The
lips parted, but no sound came forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak,&#8221; cried Van Horne sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been executed, I cannot speak. I
am dead.&#8221; The words came from the man in
jerky, spasmodic sentences as if torn from him
against his will.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, I command you, what has happened
since I left you this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am dead,&#8221; repeated the murderer in a dull,
mechanical tone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>Dr. Van Horne stepped once more to the
chair. He held one hand firmly against the
man&#8217;s forehead. The other he reached down
behind the head and pressed at the base of the
brain.</p>

<p>Again the man began to speak, this time
more rapidly than before, but in a harsh, cackling
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;They came and took me from my cell and
put me in a chair. They strapped me down,
and put sponges on my spine and on my ankles.
Then they put ten thousand needles into my
body, and I began to grow cold and numb. My
heart stopped beating, and I could not breathe.
And now I am dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are breathing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now I am dead,&#8221; repeated the other
mechanically.</p>

<p>Dr. Van Horne loosened his hands from the
man, and turned to the watching group.</p>

<p>&#8220;So far I have succeeded,&#8221; said he. &#8220;So far
my theory is correct. The electricity did not
produce death in this man because his brain
could not receive the sensation. Now I am going
to bring him out of the hypnotic state and
see if my theory is entirely correct.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not state what that theory was, but
stepped back to the man in the chair and began
speaking in a low tone. He took both eyelids,
and rolling them up, looked straight into the
sleeper&#8217;s eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>&#8220;Jean Lescaut,&#8221; he cried sharply, &#8220;come to
yourself! You are no longer asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time the man moved his body
slightly, as if trying to rise. Slowly a bright
red spot began to appear on each pallid cheek.
His eyes rolled down from under the lids, and
the pupils began to dilate.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, an awful horror came into his
face, and without a word of warning, as if impelled
by some unseen force, he leaped forward,
and fell writhing and twisting on the floor over
eight feet away. His arms and legs beat the
air and floor for a minute convulsively, then
stiffened into strange, grotesque positions.</p>

<p>Dr. Van Horne knelt down beside the body
and examined it carefully. Then he stood up
and smiled, though he was very pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I was entirely correct
in my theory. Had I not expected this ending,
I would never have dared to thus violate the
law and bring this man back to life. That
deadly charge of electricity which was held back
from acting by the influence of my hypnotism
has at last accomplished its work, as you yourselves
just saw. When the numbness produced
by hypnotic sleep left the man&#8217;s brain, nature
began to act, and the shock to the nervous system
was all the more powerful because the electricity
had changed its form to a static charge.
You need not fear; this time he is really
dead.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>And thus Jean Lescaut, wife poisoner and
perpetrator of a dozen crimes, helped in his expiation
of those crimes to advance the cause
of science; and justice was not cheated, for the
execution of his sentence was merely postponed
the matter of a few hours.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;BUD PHILLIPS says The
Boy is going to the devil,&#8221;
announced Stebbins, as he
strolled into the smoking
room at the Sherwood Club,
after beating Perkins three
games of billiards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Bud is certainly in a position to be
accurately informed on that subject,&#8221; answered
the Colonel; and the truth of his reply was so
apparent, that everyone smiled.</p>

<p>Bud was night clerk at the Algonquin, the
hotel where The Boy had a suite. So he had a
chance to see at what hour and how the guests
came home. He also knew just how many
times a week The Boy&#8217;s rooms were a rendezvous
for the young subalterns from Fort Blair,
who came into town every time they could get
leave, to gamble away their month&#8217;s scanty pay.</p>

<p>But as Bud Phillips also said, The Boy wasn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
entirely to blame, for he had never had a mother&#8217;s
care; and, though no one in Preston City
except the Colonel and I knew the facts of his
early life, everyone had a good word for him,
and was inclined to overlook many indiscretions
on the part of popular Billy Richards, The Boy.</p>

<p>Colonel Wade and I could remember the day
when Stewart Sloan shocked the good people
back in Sioux City by bringing home for a
wife La Petite Mabelle, skirt dancer from a
vaudeville theatre in Des Moines. The predictions
of the sewing-club gossips were more
than fulfilled, for La Petite Mabelle ran away
one fine day before the year was up, leaving
Sloan with a two-months-old baby boy, and a
little note of farewell. La Petite Mabelle told
him in melodramatic sentences, covering two
sheets of note paper, that the attractions of the
old life, with its cheap finery and grease paint,
were too strong for her. She could never remain
in Sioux City, where nobody called on her,
Stewart himself seemed ashamed of her, and
where there was nothing going on. She said
further, that he mustn&#8217;t think too badly of her,
and that he ought to try and forget her.</p>

<p>This Sloan had certainly tried hard enough to
do. That fall he secured a divorce, and when
the legislature convened in Des Moines next
year, he had the name that La Petite Mabelle
had disgraced changed to Richards, his mother&#8217;s
maiden name. So young William Richards, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Sloan rechristened the boy, grew up to manhood,
never knowing the tragedy of his father&#8217;s
early life, and never having felt the softening
influence of a mother&#8217;s love.</p>

<p>His father died when the lad was twelve, naming
as his son&#8217;s guardian Colonel Wade, who
looked after him as well as an old bachelor of
fifty, loaded down with business cares, could be
expected to look after a growing and spirited
youth.</p>

<p>When Billy attained his majority, and had finished
his college days, bluff old Colonel Wade
took him aside as gently as a warm-hearted old
man could do, told him the story of his first
appearance on the stage of life, turned over to
him a property more than sufficient for every
reasonable need, and sent him out in the world
which still called him The Boy, a nickname he
had acquired in college. The Boy pondered
over his early history for a few days, and then
apparently forgot that any such unpleasant
thing as history existed, concerning himself
wholly with the present, which may be history,
though at the time not recognized as such.</p>

<p>Lately The Boy had been drinking and doing
some other things more than was good for him;
but when the Colonel remonstrated in a fatherly
way, he promised to &#8220;take a brace,&#8221; the same
as he would have promised back in his college
days, when he was under the discipline of the
old professors. Stebbins&#8217;s remark, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
that The Boy was going to the devil, was rather
a surprise to me, for I knew that he usually kept
his word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did any of you see the fairy that came in
on the express this afternoon?&#8221; asked Perkins
a little later, and as no one answered, he proceeded
to explain:</p>

<p>&#8220;I went down to the three o&#8217;clock to meet
Kitty, who came in from Denver to-day; and
the first person who stepped off the train was
the d&mdash;&mdash;st looking female you ever saw. She
must have been forty-five; but she had locks as
golden as a maid of fifteen, and actually, I believe
there was half a box of rouge on her cheeks.
She had a little woolly dog in her arms, so covered
with ribbons that I don&#8217;t believe it could
walk alone. Kitty said she was flirting with
the conductor all the way down from Butte, and
some one on the train christened her &#8216;The Painted
Lady.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s she stopping?&#8221; asked the Colonel,
and I knew what was in his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;She rode up town on the same &#8217;bus with
Kitty and me, and got out at the Algonquin,&#8221;
answered Perkins. &#8220;You&#8217;d better look out for
that protégé of yours, Colonel, he may be doing
something rash. The Boy appears to be partial
to blondes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day as I was coming down town I
nearly upset a woman hurrying in the opposite
direction. I picked up the parasol which I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
knocked out of her hand, and as I glanced at
her, I knew from Perkins&#8217;s description that she
was The Painted Lady.</p>

<p>She probably wasn&#8217;t more than thirty-seven
or thirty-eight, but there were deep lines about
her eyes and the corners of the mouth which
ought not to be in the face of a woman of sixty.
Her hair, under the stimulating influence of
peroxide, was a bright yellow, and her cheeks
had on them the bloom usually found on buxom
Irish lasses, or in small, round boxes in a
drug store. At the end of a silver chain, and
covered with ribbons, was a diminutive French
poodle.</p>

<p>She was stylishly dressed, and her figure,
though making me wonder at the time (and
strength) taken to produce it, was still quite
pleasing to look upon in the final result. Her
name, as I found out at the club that evening,
was Madame Mabel Fortesque, and one
of the evening papers stated that she was
a young widow taking a western trip for her
health. She had a suite at the Algonquin, and
spent most of her time driving about the city,
for she had sent to Denver for a showy turnout,
and it was not long before it became a common
sight to see her riding about with some one of
the young officers from Fort Blair beside her.</p>

<p>Dame Rumor, never inclined to be delicate in
her handling of young widows who travel about
the country without chaperons, of course had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
fling at Madame Fortesque; and if only half the
stories which were circulated about her were
true, she must have found Preston City a lively
place.</p>

<p>The day of her arrival The Boy had been
called away to Chicago on business, so the Colonel
and I were relieved of any immediate worry
as to an acquaintance being established between
him and The Painted Lady, as nearly everyone
in Preston City quickly came to call the widow.</p>

<p>The Boy came back two weeks later, however,
and our worst fears were then realized, for he
immediately became as attentive to Madame
Fortesque as any of the young subalterns
from the fort. Most of the men at the club
talked it over good-naturedly, and, man-fashion,
considered it a good joke; but the wives of
these same club men regarded it differently; it
was even rumored that old Mrs. Burton, the
worst gossip in the city, had written to a girl in
Boston to whom The Boy was engaged.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she were only some young thing and good-looking,&#8221;
groaned the Colonel, &#8220;it wouldn&#8217;t be
so bad; but what he can find in that fudged-up
old woman is more than I can see. Why, man,
she is old enough to be his mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>He intended to speak to The Boy about it
but never did, for he knew he could not talk to
the young man when there was a woman in the
case, the same as he could when it was merely
a question of his gambling or drinking too much.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>Things were going on badly enough, when
one evening as I was seated in the reading-room
at the Sherwood, looking over a paper, I
heard Stebbins talking to a group in the next
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve found out the whole history of
The Painted Lady,&#8221; he was saying; &#8220;she&#8217;s all
that Old Lady Burton says, and more. She&#8217;s
been living down at the Rapids for a year or
two; and I saw Jack Denvers when I was down
there last week, and he gave me the whole
story. She was a skirt-dancer among other
things when she was young, and some way got
her hooks onto a young fellow from Sioux City
named Sloan. He came from a fine family,
and his people were all broken up over the
affair, for she proved a bad lot, I reckon. She
ran away from him before they had been married
a year, and has been going down the line
ever since. Denvers says that if she stops up
here the married women would better watch
out. She&#8217;s the woman that was mixed up in the
Stanley divorce case down at the Rapids last
year; and they say she got&mdash;Hello! what&#8217;s
the matter with Billy? Same old story?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alarmed, for I had not the slightest idea that
The Boy was there, I turned and saw him
staggering blindly from the room. He ran
against a hat-tree, and some of the men laughed,
but I saw his face, and I knew that it was not
the drink that made him look so ghastly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>I hurried up to the card-room where the
Colonel was playing his evening game of whist,
and, whispering a word in his ear, I got him
into an alcove and told him what had just
taken place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God! this is horrible,&#8221; he muttered;
&#8220;why, it&#8217;s his own mother, and he knows it.&#8221;</p>

<p>We hastened from the club, but there were
no carriages in sight outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Boy just staggered out bareheaded,
and drove off toward his hotel in the only cab
here,&#8221; said Perkins, who was coming up the
steps. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with him? I spoke
to him, but he didn&#8217;t answer. Stewed again?&#8221;</p>

<p>We did not stop to satisfy his curiosity, but
walked rapidly up to the Algonquin.</p>

<p>&#8220;He went up-stairs about ten minutes ago,&#8221;
the clerk told us in answer to our question, and
grinned knowingly.</p>

<p>The door of his room was not locked, and
after knocking several times without getting
any reply, we went in, and found just what I
had feared we should find, The Boy lying face
downwards on the floor, one hand clasping a
discharged revolver. I looked at the powder-stained
cheek, and though I felt that it was
absolutely hopeless, I left the Colonel kneeling
by his side, and hurried out in search of a
doctor. As I stood by the front door hesitating
which way to go, a trap was driven up under
the electric lights, and a beardless youth in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
lieutenant&#8217;s uniform helped a loudly-dressed
woman to alight. They walked through the
foyer, and entered the elevator laughing and
talking, while a little yellow dog, covered with
ribbons, capered and barked in front of them.</p>

<p>It was The Painted Lady&mdash;and another boy.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_139.jpg"  alt="T"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE following advertisement,
even had it ever appeared in
any of the great dailies, would
probably have occasioned little
comment or curiosity:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Those who are weary of the laws
and so-called &#8220;society restrictions&#8221; of
the present day can find an immediate
and complete relief by applying at once to JENIFER VASS,
Lock Box 3265B.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even in 1885, though the business had not
then attained the gigantic proportions of the
present day, the advertising genius was still at
work; and any one chancing to read such a
notice would no doubt have set it down as the
bait thrown out by the vendor of some patent
medicine, weight lift, or equally undesirable article.</p>

<p>The promoters of the scheme for the &#8220;Pursuance
of Vice,&#8221; as they facetiously called it
among themselves, realized this, and did not attempt
to reach the public by any such open
means. To make known their project they resorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to other methods which, though acting
quietly and unnoticed, nevertheless produced
sufficient effect, so that on the night of June 16,
1885, when the floating palace of Iniquity, &#8220;Lawless,&#8221;
left one of the North-river piers, she had
on board eight hundred souls. That is to say,
there were eight hundred passengers; but, judging
from the declared object with which the
&#8220;Lawless&#8221; put to sea, it is more probable that
the souls of those on board had been left behind.</p>

<p>This voyage of the &#8220;Lawless&#8221; was the result
of much thought on the part of three individuals
who, at one time or another, had figured prominently
in the police courts of New York and
Chicago. Jenifer Vass, in whose brain the plan
had first found its inception, was at one time
proprietor of the Red Inn, a feeble imitation of
the Moulin Rouge of Paris; while Jackson
Elbers and Louis Hopeman had both been mixed
up in various enterprises, all of which tended to
cater to the animal rather than the intellectual
passions of their patrons.</p>

<p>Three miles from land, as you may not happen
to know, is the limit of distance to which the
law of the neighboring country applies. When
beyond that point on the high seas no law on
earth is valid save the orders of the ship&#8217;s captain.
Knowing this fact, and from the knowledge
of human nature gained in their various
former pursuits, the three men mentioned had
gotten together a few thousand dollars and purchased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the Atlanta, once an ocean liner of the
White Star line.</p>

<p>The Atlanta had been taken from the passenger
service, being unable to compete with her
faster rivals on the Cunard and Hamburg-Bremen
lines; and it was planned to remodel and
use her for a freight steamer.</p>

<p>Hearing of this, and as speed was no object
in the excursions which the Palace of Sin was to
make, Jenifer Vass and his two companions
made an offer which was immediately accepted
by the managers of the White Star line.</p>

<p>Then a work of transformation began. According
to the scheme of Jenifer Vass, every
vice which tempts men and women, every form
of iniquity of the old and the new world, was to
be introduced, cultivated, and pampered on
board the &#8220;Lawless.&#8221; Ten staterooms were torn
to pieces and made into one. The floors were
covered with Turkish rugs; Bagdad curtains
and Eastern ornaments were hung about the
walls. The final appearance of the room was
totally different from the little holes in the wall
found in the Chinatown of nearly all the large
cities, but its object was the same. Here men
and women could smoke opium from morning
till night, and with the additional advantage that
no one would disturb them. There was no
danger of the place being raided and their names
appearing in the next morning&#8217;s police-court
items. On one of the walls was arranged a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
set of bunks on which the sleepers could be laid
away when the drug was really on.</p>

<p>One-half the ship was converted into a gambling
hall. Here every game of chance at
Monte Carlo,&mdash;faro, roulette, poker, pinquette,
fantan, and every other game by which a man
can win a fortune or lose his all in a single night&mdash;was
to be put in operation.</p>

<p>There was to be a bar where every known
strong drink could be bought, and each man
was to be the judge of when he had had enough.
No waiter could inform him that the management
refused to serve him anything more, and
he would have to go elsewhere. Here one
could swill brandy, absinthe, bhang, or any other
nerve-destroying drink until his brain reeled;
and as long as he had the money to pay for
more no one would stop him.</p>

<p>Every drug and narcotic, whose sale is guarded
by the laws of the United States and other civilized
countries, was to be sold as freely as the
chocolates of the confectioner. Cocaine, opium,
laudanum, and morphine were laid in in bulk
for the use of the passengers of the &#8220;Lawless,&#8221;
without limit or restriction. In fact, there was
wine for the drinker, women for him who wanted
company, song for him who would sing, and each
and every other evil thing ever devised by a
wicked and lustful world was to be found somewhere
between the two decks of this Palace of
Sin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>The trips were to last one month, the &#8220;Lawless&#8221;
merely getting into mid ocean and steaming
slowly down to the Gulf of Mexico, remaining
there until the month was up, when the
passengers, saturated with vice and steeped in
corruption, were to be returned to the place of
starting. The crew was cut down to as small a
number as possible, and consisted mostly of the
riffraff to be found about the wharves of any
large seaport city.</p>

<p>There was nothing about the scheme which
could be punished by the laws of any country,
nevertheless the arrangements were kept as
quiet as possible, and nothing found its way into
the papers.</p>

<p>On the night of June 16, 1885, the &#8220;Lawless,&#8221;
as the boat was very appropriately rechristened,
steamed away from New York. The passengers
had begun to arrive in the evening as
soon as it became dark, and at 12.30 every one
who had engaged passage was on board. There
was no one down to the pier to speed the departing
voyager, or to wish him good luck. The
sinister expedition set out without as much as
the wave of a handkerchief from shore. She
was a little longer in getting under way than had
been anticipated, but at two o&#8217;clock in the morning
of the seventeenth, the &#8220;Lawless&#8221; was well
out to sea, and the great hull, which up till then,
save for a few lights about deck, had been kept
dark, burst suddenly into light. Down in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
hold a big Westinghouse generator was whirling
away, and, at a word from the captain, fifteen
hundred electric lights were suddenly switched
into circuit and the &#8220;Lawless&#8221; was on full
blast. The limit was reached, and the ship had
come to her own.</p>

<p>There was one flaw, however, in the scheme
of the Palace of Sin. That flaw was Pierre
Planchette, first assistant engineer. Like most
of the lower officers, he had been hired without
knowing the object of the voyage, thinking that
the &#8220;Lawless&#8221; was merely bound on a pleasure
cruise in southern waters. He had just come
from the Bellevue hospital, where he had been
dangerously sick with brain fever, and he was
still far from recovered, but hearing of the position
and the high pay that went with it, he had
left the hospital against the orders of the house
physician. The man who had been originally
hired for assistant having disappointed Jenifer
Vass, the patient, with traces of the fever still
upon him, was engaged on the very day of
departure.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the three-mile limit was
passed, and the hell up on deck broke out, Pierre
Planchette turned to his chief for explanation of
the sounds of revelry floating down below decks.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say you don&#8217;t know the
object of this ship?&#8221; asked the chief. &#8220;Why,
the &#8216;Lawless&#8217; is a floating hell. For the next
thirty days every form of vice known to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
civilized world will be going on up above there.
There&#8217;s five hundred men and three hundred
women in this gilded shell whose only object in
life for one month will be to commit acts which
on shore would be punished by fines and imprisonment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a word the assistant left the chief
engineer, and seeking out the captain, demanded
to be put on shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve signed with us for one month, and,
by G&mdash;d, you&#8217;ll have to stay,&#8221; was all the
answer he got from Jenifer Vass, to whom the
captain sent him.</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened. Into the
disordered brain of the man, a short time before
racked by fever, there came the thought that he
had been chosen by God to be the instrument
to punish the iniquity which had come to his
knowledge.</p>

<p>He returned to the captain, and demanded a
raise of fifteen dollars a month in his pay, claiming
he did not know the kind of a job he was
undertaking when he had signed. O, he was
cunning, this fever stricken assistant engineer.
He knew how to allay suspicion.</p>

<p>The raise of pay was granted, for Jenifer Vass
did not like the look in the man&#8217;s eyes. Planchette
went about his work, however, for the
next few days quietly and apparently satisfied.
And when by chance his duties took him up to
where the painted women sang and gamed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the drunken men made ribald jests, he only
smiled strangely to himself and went on with
his work. But he was busy all this time doing
many things for which an assistant engineer is
not usually paid to perform.</p>

<p>One evening he came to Vass, the man who
was really in command of the &#8220;Lawless,&#8221; and
asked to be shown about the ship. It was a
strange request for an under officer to make to
the owner of a ship, but Vass, as usual somewhat
in his cups, and feeling particularly good-natured,
for the money was coming in faster than he had
dared to hope, consented.</p>

<p>Together they went into the gaming room,
and the young engineer saw crowds of men and
women standing about the whirling wheels, or
sitting about the tables with the light of greed
in their eyes. Here a woman laughed shrilly as
the croupier pushed toward her a pile of money,
while beside her a man cursed his luck in language
which would have shamed a demon.</p>

<p>They went to the opium den and saw men
and women, some safely tucked away on the
little shelves, others sitting on low divans, while
half a dozen grinning Chinamen cooked the little
brown beads and brought to them. They went
into other rooms, seeing sights which I will not
describe, and everywhere suggestive songs and
oaths met their ears.</p>

<p>That night about 12 o&#8217;clock a man slipped
about the decks of the &#8220;Lawless,&#8221; making little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
noise but working busily. He went to the
ship&#8217;s boats and removed from all save the one
in the stern small sections of the bottom which
had been cunningly sawed out. He went down
in the hold to each of the pumps, and smiled to
himself as he noted the cylinders from which
the plungers had been removed. Then he drew
a few more cans of oil and carried them down
to where the coal was stored, and when he returned
the cans were empty. From there he
went to his cabin and carried a few more things
to the one boat in the stern which had not been
tampered with.</p>

<p>Then, although everything was completed, he
paused irresolutely. He went to some of the
rooms into which Jenifer Vass had taken him
earlier in the evening. He did not go into
them, but stood and listened to the sounds
which came out through transoms and half-opened
doors, and, as he listened, the former
look of determination began to come back to
his face.</p>

<p>He paused for a minute outside the drinking
room, listening to the chorus of a vulgar song.
The door opened and a couple of men staggering
out started for the part of the ship given
over to the women. As they lurched past him
Planchette heard a remark one of them made
to the other. He turned and walked swiftly to
the hold, and lighting a match, held it over the
spot on the coal where nearly a barrel of oil had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
soaked in. Then he stole back to the upper
deck, slipped the ship&#8217;s boat carefully over the
side and dropped into the sea.</p>

<p>He remained perfectly motionless, watching
the great form of the &#8220;Lawless&#8221; as she steamed
slowly past him. Taking up his oars he pulled
along for a little way, and the distance between
him and the ship did not increase greatly, for, as
has been observed, speed of traveling was not one
of the pleasures promised to the passengers of
the &#8220;Lawless.&#8221; In a little while he saw a number
of lights flash out on deck, and the black
forms of many men hurrying to and fro were
silhouetted against the sky. Then, suddenly,
above the roar of the water he heard the piercing
shriek of a woman. He shivered slightly
and ceased rowing.</p>

<p>The ship&#8217;s engines had stopped, and the boat
was rolling heavily on the swell. Great clouds
of black smoke began to pour from the hatchways,
and across the water he heard the sound
of men trying to get out the boats, an undertaking
followed immediately by an angry cursing
in which he heard his own name mingled. But
he only smiled again, that same strange smile
that had been on his face for the last week
when as he worked down in the bowels of the
ship, he heard the sounds of riot above.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be after the pumps now,&#8221; muttered
the instrument of God to himself, and he
laughed mirthlessly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>He took up his oars and began rowing again.
He knew it was many miles to the nearest land,
but he must get away from that great flaming
eye, which seemed to be winking at him. The
cries and shrieks of despair from those on board
the burning ship were awful to hear, so he sang
loudly and drowned out the noise.</p>

<p>He rowed furiously till nearly daybreak,
when, sinking to the bottom of the boat, he
slept from sheer exhaustion. When he opened
his eyes again the sun was high in the heavens.
He looked around him for some trace of his last
night&#8217;s work, but only the great green expanse
of water met his eye. There was not a speck
on the waters. Of the eight hundred passengers
who had set out a week before in pursuit
of sin not one remained.</p>

<p>Five days later the BORUS, a merchantman
plying between Savannah and New York, picked
up a man off Hatteras, drifting about in a boat.
He had neither oars nor provisions, and was
raving with delirium. He was carried back to
New York and taken to Bellevue hospital, where
he was identified by the house physician as the
man who had left there against orders two weeks
before scarcely recovered from brain fever. He
had a lucid interval three days later, during
which the nurse learned much of the foregoing.</p>

<p>The man died that night muttering of a
Palace of Sin which was smitten by the hand
of God.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_153.jpg"  alt="F"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOUR young men sat around
a table one winter&#8217;s night in
an old New England country
house. Their host, Richard
Churchill, was a civil engineer,
who had inherited some property,
including this old estate,
from an aunt; and he was giving a little winter
stag party to three of his old college friends.
On the table was a steaming punch bowl, and
scattered about were pipes, tobacco and cigars.
The conversation touched lightly on various
subjects; the struggle in the Islands, the coming
great presidential contest, and other current
events. Captain Van Patten, a West Point
graduate, who had done some things worthy
of mention, and won the bars on his shoulder
straps at San Juan Hill, had just made a statement
regarding the courage of a recent great
naval commander.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may talk about the courage that
prompts men to do bold deeds in the bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
sunshine, with hundreds of men cheering and
fighting beside them, but the man who has the
real courage, is the one who, on a dark night
like this, dares to walk by himself into a lonely
graveyard, and sit on a newly made grave.&#8221; It
was the host who had spoken, but as he had
had the reputation at college of being afraid of
the dark, there was a general laugh at his
expense.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said one of the other young men,
who was a doctor, and so accustomed to gruesome
sights, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t require much courage,
and besides,&#8221; he added, looking at the deep
snowbanks outside, &#8220;one couldn&#8217;t very well sit
on a newly made grave to-night, for the ground
is frozen solid, and there are snow-drifts two
feet deep. However, there are several bodies
in the vault over in the cemetery yonder, and I
am willing to wager that no one here dares walk
over and knock three times on the iron door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; answered Captain Van
Patten, carelessly, &#8220;that you civilians have a
very primitive idea of courage. If you will make
a wager that would tempt a man to leave this
most delicious punch, and such delightful company,
I will venture to go over and bring back
a souvenir from your terrible tomb. Churchill,
our host here, as nearest resident to the village
graveyard, is no doubt supplied with a key to
the tomb.&#8221; He looked inquiringly at the young
civil engineer, who nodded. &#8220;Well, as I remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
before, for a sufficient wager I will agree
to bring back to you one of the bats which probably
haunt the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor, somewhat nettled at the bantering
tone of the captain, rose as if to make what
he was about to say more impressive, and said,
slowly, &#8220;In that tomb there was placed this
afternoon the body of Andrew Phelps, who died
in church last Sunday from heart failure. The
clothes of the corpse included a black frock suit
and a black silk tie. I know these things, because
the village undertaker was away, and I
was called in to assist in preparing the body for
burial. I will wager this gentleman, who seems
not to be afraid,&#8221; he added sarcastically, &#8220;one
hundred dollars that he does not dare, at twelve
o&#8217;clock to-night, leave this courageous company,
unlock the tomb, force open the coffin, and
bring back to this room within the hour that
same black neckcloth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Taken,&#8221; answered the captain promptly;
and drawing a check-book from his pocket, he
wrote a check for the amount. &#8220;And now,&#8221;
he continued, &#8220;as I see the clock indicates
11.30, I shall have to request as quickly as possible
the loan of a hammer and screw-driver.&#8221;</p>

<p>They brought him the necessary tools, he
wrapped himself in his great coat, and left the
house whistling nonchalantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell him which was the squire&#8217;s
coffin,&#8221; said the doctor after Van Patten had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
left. &#8220;It might give even his iron nerves a
shock if he opened the coffin in which they
buried the remains of the tramp who was run
over on the Central last week, and was picked
up in pieces in a basket,&mdash;all except the head,
which was never found.&#8221;</p>

<p>Van Patten trudged along through the snow
toward the tomb. He wasn&#8217;t a timid young
man in any sense of the word, and the present
excursion was nothing but a little adventure,
which he could work up with frequent tellings
into a good after-dinner story. &#8220;Rather a nasty
night,&#8221; he muttered to himself, as he turned in
at the cemetery gate. There was not a star in
sight, and the sky was full of great threatening
black clouds, which probably meant snow before
morning.</p>

<p>He unlocked the tomb, and stepped inside,
but it was some time before he could make out
in the inky darkness where what he was seeking
lay. There were three wooden boxes resting on
iron bars set into the cement wall. All were
of about the same length, and there was nothing
by which to distinguish one from the other, as
he felt them over.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder he wouldn&#8217;t have told me
there was a party of them here. How&#8217;s a man
to know who&#8217;s who?&#8221; said the captain to himself,
and he gave a slight shiver. &#8220;Well, here goes
for luck, anyway,&#8221; and he began to unscrew the
lid from the nearest coffin box.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>After some ten minutes&#8217; work he had the
wooden cover off, and tried to pry the coffin
open. The thing gave way at last, and he
thrust his hand in and groped about the neck of
the body, feeling for the tie. His hand met
only a mass of lace and ribbons, and to his dismay
he discovered that the corpse was that of a
woman.</p>

<p>He hurriedly replaced the cover, screwed on
the lid again, and wiped the sweat from his
brow. There was not a sound in the vault save
a thud now and then, when a piece of the ceiling,
loosened by frost, fell to the floor, or struck
on one of the wooden boxes. The humor of
the situation was all gone now, and he was
trembling as he began work on the second box.
Every few minutes his shaking hands slipped,
and the screw-driver would jam against the box
with a dull, echoing thud. In his feverish haste
he tried to turn the heavy screws with his bare
fingers; but the rough edges cut him cruelly,
and the box was soon splashed with blood. He
did not feel the pain, however, and only worked
the faster.</p>

<p>He loosened, but did not wholly remove the
lid of the box, and then reached down to pry off
the coffin cover; but he found that it was not
fastened. He thrust his hand in, and felt again
for the throat; but, to his horror, <i>there was no
throat there</i>. He passed his hand up higher,
and felt for the face, and there was only a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
bunch of frozen flowers. &#8220;You&#8217;re losing your
head, Pat,&#8221; he said to himself; but his voice was
hollow, and echoed strangely in that gruesome,
shut-in place. He reached farther down and
felt along the arm. He gave a little pull on the
hand, and it came off at the wrist. Thoroughly
unmanned, he threw the thing on the floor, and
ran shrieking from the tomb. Once outside
again, the cold air brought him back to himself
a little, but he could feel the touch of those icy
fingers on his trembling hand. He was partly
dazed, and could not reason rightly. The long
strain had been too much for him, but one
thought remained uppermost in his mind; he
must get that black silk neck cloth from the
man whose coffin still remained unopened.</p>

<p>He forced himself back into the tomb, but his
heart fluttered strangely, as he knelt beside the
last box. He did not stop to remove the
screws, but drove the hammer under the cover,
and twisted and wrenched the boards off furiously.
The coffin lid withstood his efforts for
some time, for the fastenings were strong; but
at last they, too, gave way. He reached down
for the throat again, dreading lest he should find
some new horror. His hand touched a moist
face, and the man in the coffin stirred and
groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lie still, damn you!&#8221; he shrieked, and
seized the man brutally by the throat. A hand
cold and clammy clutched his feebly. &#8220;Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
go!&#8221; he screamed with another curse, and
struck the face angrily with his hand. He tore
the neckcloth, collar and all, from the man&#8217;s
throat, and started to turn away, when a low
voice came from the coffin. With a laugh that
was not nice to hear, Van Patten staggered
across the vault. As he neared the door his
head struck against one of the iron coffin supports
and he fell heavily to the ground.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Van Patten&#8217;s three friends sat around the
table in the country house, anxiously waiting
for the return of the captain. The wager was
lost to Van Patten, for it was nearly two hours
since he left the house, and the men were about
to start out in search of him, when the front
door opened and someone staggered into the
lighted room from the hall. But the white-faced
man who lurched toward them, with
clothes torn and covered with blood, was not
the captain, but Andrew Phelps. He talked
wildly and incoherently; but they gathered from
his ravings that he had been rescued from a living
grave by someone who had immediately set
upon him like a madman.</p>

<p>Leaving the doctor with him, the other two
men started out in search of the missing captain.
They did not find him on the road leading
to the cemetery; but when they neared the
vault they found the door half opened, while the
sound of maniacal singing came out through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the night. They pushed the door wide open,
and there by the dim light of the lanterns a
strange sight shocked their gaze.</p>

<p>Two of the coffins were broken open. One
was empty; but partially in the other and partly
scattered about the tomb, as if thrown as a child
tosses its playthings, were some ghastly things,
the sight of which made young Churchill sick
and faint. On the edge of the coffin in which
the body of the tramp had been placed sat Van
Patten; but he did not look up as they entered.
They brought the light close to his face, but he
only leered vacantly at them and continued
singing.</p>

<p>In one hand he held something on which he
was trying to fit his fur glove, and at his feet
lay a torn black neckcloth.</p>

<p class="ph1">THE STORY THE DOCTOR TOLD.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_163.jpg"  alt="T"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TO begin with, let me say that I
am not a story-teller, neither
can I make fine phrases nor
coin strange words which shall
delight the ear. I am only a
country doctor, getting well
along in years, and I write this
tale only because I promised Richard Crew so
to do, as I held his feverish hand while he lay
and tossed in pain, and prayed for a death that
would not come.</p>

<p>So without further excuse or apology, let me
begin. Richard Crew was the only son of Sir
Davies Crew, distinguished as artist, soldier, and
scholar. His mother, Anne Sargent, was the
fairest Englishwoman it has ever been my privilege
to know. Of money there was a plenty on
both sides; so when the young lad Richard
reached his eighteenth year, and under his father&#8217;s
careful teaching showed a decided taste for
painting, he was sent forthwith to Paris and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
placed under the best master that gold could
procure.</p>

<p>As family physician of the Crews, I was somewhat
of a privileged character at Redfern, as the
old estate was called, and many an evening have
I spent with old Sir Davies playing chess, or listening
to his tales of a life full of strange experiences.
It was I who helped young Richard to
first blink his large blue eyes on this world, and
who attended him through his trials of teething,
measles, and all the other evils to which childhood
is heir. It was my hand also which reverently
closed the eyes of Lady Anne after a short
illness, the very year that Richard went to Paris.</p>

<p>Sir Davies never recovered from the shock
of his wife&#8217;s death, and what with brooding over
her loss, shutting himself up in his room, and
neglecting the exercise that a man of his physique
always requires, I was deeply grieved but not
surprised when Bingham, the head butler, came
down to the house one evening to inform me
that Sir Davies had died in an apoplectic fit
during dinner.</p>

<p>It is a bad thing for most boys who are about
to come of age to fall heir to a lot of money, but
when that boy is a student in the Latin Quarter
of Paris, is fair to look upon, popular with his
set, and generous to a fault, the result can be
imagined.</p>

<p>For the next three years I saw very little of
Richard. He came to Redfern only occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
in the summer, and then he was always
accompanied by a gay crowd of his Paris associates;
artists like himself, scribblers for some
Paris sheet, and the hangers-on invariably to be
found in the train of the rich young man.
These visits to his old home became rarer and
rarer, for which the country people around were
very glad, for they had developed into little
better than riotous orgies; when nights, for
weeks at a time, were spent in carousals, and
the days in resting up only for another night.</p>

<p>Exercising what I considered my right as an
old friend of the family, I called one morning at
Redfern to remonstrate with the boy, but I
came away sorry that I had made the attempt.
It was hard to imagine that the dissipated
young wreck, with trembling hands and swollen,
bloodshot eyes, was the same lad whom I saw
the morning of his journey to Paris, as he
whirled by on the coach and waved his cap to
me in farewell.</p>

<p>It was the same sad, old story; wine, women,
and song, and then more wine and more women,
and for seven long years the son of my dear old
friend lived the life that is worse than death,
and then came back to Redfern with the seal of
sin upon his brow.</p>

<p>Only once did I see him that summer after
my morning call. Then I was called up at two
in the morning by a young man in Austrian
uniform, who, half drunk himself, begged me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a maudlin way to come up to the house, for
young Crew was down with the &#8220;jumps,&#8221; as he
called it. I went with him of course, and found
Richard in the old banquet room with a motley
crowd of men and women bending over him, as
he lay stretched out on the couch.</p>

<p>I have seen many men in my life who have
drunk too much, and are tasting that bitter after
draught by which an abused system avenges
itself, and I looked to find a far different sight
from that which met my eyes as they made
room for me about the couch. In the white
drawn face before me there was nothing but
fear, not ordinary healthy fear such as every
man at times experiences, but a kind of speechless
horror; and his eyes, as they turned toward
me, had in them the fathomless misery
of a lost soul.</p>

<p>His lips moved, and I heard him pleading
faintly with somebody or something to go away
and leave him for a little while; but as entreaties
did no good he tried to bribe the thing,
and offered a thousand, ten thousand pounds to
be left in peace. Then, as nothing seemed to
avail, his voice rose to a frenzied scream, and he
cursed the thing that haunted him, the God that
made him, yes, and the mother who bore him.</p>

<p>At last, worn out and exhausted, he sank
back to the floor, and I succeeded in getting
him into a fitful sleep, while that crowd of
tawdry, painted women and drunken men crept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
past him out of the room, with all the laughter
gone from their faces.</p>

<p class="caption"><b>&#8220;The next day I was surprised by a visit from the
young man.&#8221;</b> (See page 167.)</p>

<p>The next day I was surprised by a visit from
the young man, who, as might be expected of
one in his position, was thoroughly frightened.
I explained to him, as a man of medicine, just
what his condition the night before meant, and
he promised solemnly, and of his own accord,
not to touch anything more for a year. Then
he told me what he had seen the night before;
for, strange to say, he remembered perfectly all
he had been through. As he lay there, he said,
he could see across the room, slowly forming
itself out of nothing, and yet having a frightful
form, some hideous thing which, neither man
nor beast, and yet resembling both, approached
slowly, grinning at him. He could not describe
it more definitely, for he had not learned to
know it as he afterwards did. All that I could
find out was that it was a great flabby creature
that waddled as it walked; and though it had a
face, it was not like anything he had ever seen.</p>

<p>As regards this pledge to me, I think he
kept it, for I heard indirectly from him several
times during the year, and the report was always
good. He was back again in Paris, but
had given up all his old companions, and was
working faithfully. That year one of his pictures
received a prize in the salon, and he was
prophesied a great future.</p>

<p>I was away during the next year and a half,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
looking up interests of mine in America, and
heard little that was going on among my own
people. On the evening of my return to our
village, therefore, I was surprised to see the big
house at Redfern gaily illuminated, and was told
by the servants that there had been bad doings
up on the hill for many a day. The temptation
of the old life had been too strong; he had
gathered his all too willing crowd of former
associates around him, and was &#8220;celebrating&#8221;
with all the pent up passion of a <i>roué</i> who has
walked in the narrow path for nearly a year.</p>

<p>He was sick with his old trouble twice that
month, and both times for old friendship&#8217;s sake
I did what I could for him; but I saw there
must come an end before many months. But
such an end!</p>

<p>I was surprised one day to hear the servants
talking in the next room, for they said that all
the crowd at Redfern had left for the city that
morning, with the exception of Master Richard,
who was shut up in his room working all day
like mad on some picture, and drinking furiously
at night.</p>

<p>The end of it all came one night two weeks
later, about ten o&#8217;clock in the evening, when one
of the maids came down to my house, white and
trembling, to tell me that &#8220;Master Richard was
down with the horrors again, worse than ever,
and would I please come up as quick as possible.&#8221;
I hurried on a hat and coat, and followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
her up the hill. As we turned in at the little
gate in the garden I was startled by a shriek
so terrible that I turned to the trembling maid
questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way he&#8217;s been at it for an hour,
sir,&#8221; she whispered, and her teeth chattered as
she spoke, though the night was not cold.</p>

<p>She left me at the door of his room and I
went in alone. At first I could see nothing, for
the light was turned down; but from the bed
there came a low, moaning noise. Then, suddenly,
the clothes were thrown aside, and, God
help me, I saw a face the like of which I pray
I may never see again. I have doctored many
men in my time, and I have seen some sights
that are not nice to think about; but never
have I seen such nameless horror, such uncontrollable
fear, as looked at me from the eyes of
that man.</p>

<p>He stood there for a minute gibbering and
making strange noises like a beast; and then
jumping from the bed, he ran to a piece of canvas
standing against the wall and covered by a
thick drapery. He pulled the cover aside a little
way and peeped fearfully behind. Then, in
a very paroxysm of terror, he ran shrieking and
screaming to the bed. He buried himself under
the clothes, and I could hear him sobbing and
moaning again as when I first came in. There
is to me something inexpressibly pitiful in the
sight of a man in tears, and yet I had to stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
there for three mortal hours and watch that
man. Always the same program,&mdash;the look
behind the drapery, and then that horrible
fright, which in a few minutes was followed
by another look.</p>

<p>Toward two in the morning he quieted down
suddenly, and I went and sat by the bedside
trying to soothe him to sleep; but he wanted to
talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am almost done for, doctor,&#8221; he whispered;
&#8220;but I have finished it, and it has finished
me. I have lived a bad life, a very bad
life, but on the canvas behind that drapery is
the thing God sent me to avenge my wasted
life; and when I am gone and you see what it
is that I have lived with for the last two years,
you will believe me when I say that I do not
fear the terrors of any hell hereafter.&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly and glanced fearfully
about the room, but as if reassured by the pressure
of my hand, he continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I lived straight, for over a year, after the
pledge I made you, the night of my first trouble.
I left all the old companions, and worked hard.
You saw the notice of my picture?&#8221; he asked
eagerly, and I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;During that year I met a woman who was
the very type of all that is pure and innocent,
and I even dared to think that sometime, after
I had lived down my frightful past, I might
make her my wife. But one day as I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
straining my eyes to catch the last light of the
fading afternoon, I chanced to glance over the
canvas, and, my God, there creeping out of
the darkness, was that hideous thing. I was
unconscious for several hours, but when I came
to myself I consulted the best physician in
Paris, and was under his care for over a month,
but it was of no use. Since that day it has
followed me everywhere, day and night. I tried
to drown it in drink, and it only came the
oftener. Then I sent the crowd home, and
resolved to paint a likeness of the thing, to have
always with me, so as to accustom myself to it,
but it was too awful.&#8221; His voice trailed off
into a shuddering whisper.</p>

<p>I tried to turn his thoughts to pleasant
things, and at last he began to talk of his childhood,
and how he used to ride about the country
in the little pony chaise with his mother, and
the children of the village called him &#8220;young
Master Dick.&#8221; Then, even as I watched him,
I saw creeping into his face again that nameless
horror. The pupils of his eyes grew larger
and larger till you could scarcely see the blue.
The sweat of fear started from his forehead in
huge drops; and in less time than it takes to
tell it he was again a madman.</p>

<p>He jumped to his feet and stood there for a
minute, his knees knocking drunkenly together,
and his teeth rattling like a pair of castanets,
while his eyes stared straight ahead of him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the bare wall, and then he started for the picture
again. But he never reached it. God in
his mercy spared him the agony of that last
look, and he fell forward, one hand clutching
the drapery, which went down with him to the
floor and left me staring at the thing it had
covered.</p>

<p>I looked, and something dragged me nearer,
for painted on the canvas I saw an evil, formless
thing which made my blood run cold. It
might have been a man, for it stood upon two
feet, and had arms and a head, and yet, thank
God, it was no man. Or it might have been a
devil, for if ever an imp of hell looked down
from canvas it must have had a face like that.
Yet there were no definite outlines to it. When
you tried to place a certain contour it faded off
into the somber background, and all that remained
was the head, a great flabby thing without
any nose which looked down at you and
grinned horribly.</p>

<p>If that was the demon which had haunted
Richard Crew&#8217;s fevered and disordered brain for
two long years, I thanked my God that I was
not a drinking man. I looked again and could
not turn my eyes away. Then, as I looked,
I felt that indescribable, sickening fear coming
over me that I had read in the dead man&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>The grinning thing seemed to be moving
slowly. I could see the rocking motion of the
body as it waddled toward me.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>By a mighty effort of the will I tore myself
from the spot, and seizing a French dueling
sword that hung on the wall, I hacked and cut
that leering face till only an empty frame remained,
with a few clinging shreds of tattered
canvas.</p>
